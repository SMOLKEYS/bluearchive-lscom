///// POV: Shiro /////

As we wait for Ayumu and Rin, I couldn't help but wander around in my thoughts for a while.

---

*Hmm...*

*If that president girl was the one who brought us here... how? And why?*

*Everything in this city was odd. Bipedal animals, truly sentient robots, and most of all, armed schoolgirls with haloes.*

*A place like this doesn't exist on Earth, so... an alternate universe, perhaps?*

*...*

*Why am I not surprised?*

*...*

*Heh, probably has something to do with the weird stuff we've seen or have been involved in.*

---

*First, our own home, Earth.*

*We already knew long ago about the various... "quirks" that some people had, but to actually see them in person and even be a part of it is an entire experience on its own.*

*Second, our nomadic lifestyle.*

*For 5 years, we've traveled across the entire globe. We would constantly move around, rest in hotels, or camp if we were outdoors. In that time, we would also gather souvenirs, make various friends, good associates and even learn some languages. It was pretty good, honestly.*

*And lastly, magic. ACTUAL. MAGIC.*

*A few years back, news and headlines appeared of some people suddenly being able to manipulate and control elements and bring up actual magic circles. At first, people were split in between deep intrigue in how it works, and people who were outright calling it fake, saying it was just CGI and referring to science, notably the laws of physics and thermodynamics.*

*Though, their worldview and those said laws would end up being utterly shattered within the span of a month as magic appeared EVERYWHERE, all over the globe with various people being blessed with it. Scientists tried their absolute damnedest to make it make logical sense, but failed. Meanwhile, the ones originally calling it fake were split in two categories:*

*The ones who finally believed it, and the ones who became even more... delusional, for a lack of a better term that I know of. Various conspiracy theories like the waters being drugged by the government to give the illusion of magic, or some sort of invisible drones being used to manipulate elements like fire, or projectors for the magic circles, et cetera.*

*Some people will never fail to amaze me and the others for the lengths they will go to just to deny something.*

*As for us? Well, we didn't have much to say, other than the thought of "well, this was inevitable". It wasn't a matter of IF it would happen, but WHEN. Meanwhile, surprisingly, the government hadn't tried doing anything yet. They acknowledged it, but didn't try doing anything to the people who had it. Whether or not that's out of fear or patience, I'll never know.*

*For a few months, it's just been business as usual. We eat, sleep, travel, sleep, eat, so on and so forth. Though, our routines did give us a chance to actually meet with the magic-bearers.*

*It was certainly interesting and honestly pretty damn cool, to say the least.*

*Eventually though, after a year, the 'blessings' stopped, leaving an estimated total of 15 million people with magical capabilities. During that timespan, new artifacts began to appear around the world, which could boost people's magical capabilities, allow them to utilize new kinds of magic, or even give people who didn't receive magical capabilities to actually use it. Meanwhile, existing ones also received magical power held in them.*

*Though, it wasn't all positives. Some artifacts would actually end up cursing people instead, with one of the worst cases being the Death Touch case, where a person in Europe could kill anything that he physically touched, except himself. Plant, animal, human, it didn't matter. Plants would wilt and rot immediately, while animals and humans would have their hearts and brain activity INSTANTLY stop, collapsing and ending their life then and there.*

*Unfortunately, he didn't last very long, as he would be found dead by suicide just a week after receiving the curse. Poor guy.*

*Though, anyways. Other than the dark cases, everything was, as I said, business as usual. Well, up until the last day of the magic drops.*

*Imagine our surprise when Nano ended up being one of the last 100 people to receive magical capabilities. Now imagine our surprise again when it was found out that his capabilities were amplified far, FAR higher than anyone else's.*

*...*

*...oh wait, I went FAR off track there, did I?*

*Well, to make a long story short: Shit has happened in our world, notably magic, and it made us desensitized to most surprising things.*

*Honestly, am I just in a long-ass dream, or...*

---

I pinch my cheek. Niko notices me doing that.

"Nope. Not a dream, Shiro." He points out.

"How'd you-" 

"I know you do that whenever we end up stumbling on something utterly stupid or absurd."

"...fair enough."

As I settle my long thought process, Ayumu appears from the office doors, probably done talking with Rin.

"Uhm, you may all come in now." Ayumu signals us to come into the office.

"Alright, let's go."

We stand up from the seats we're in, and walk towards the office doors, which Ayumu is holding open.

---

///// POV: Niko /////

As we step into the office, we're met with the usual cleanliness we've seen almost everywhere. This time, however, there's a girl on the main office table, probably waiting for us. Perhaps this is that "Rin" girl?

Her details are... quite elegant, to say the least. Long, straight jet black hair that almost touches the ground, with dark blue colors on the inner side that gets more saturated as it reaches the bottom, and similarly black bangs on her forehead. Alongside that is their probable standard uniform with gold buttons, and accents. Along her waist is a white belt with golden buckles, holding a pistol hoister.

Though, the most noticeable details are her elf ears and halo, which has a bluish gradient and resembles a crown of sorts.

She certainly gives off an aura of elegance and authoritativeness. Though, at the same time, she seems to be noticeably tired.

Such is the ways of being in a high position, I suppose.

"Hmm... you must be the ones the President sent, am I correct?" She guesses.

"And I assume you must be this 'Rin-chan' girl this letter was mentioning." Shiro mentions, holding the letter. Looks like both our guesses were correct, seeing her reaction to the nickname.

"...please refrain from calling me by that name." She quickly follows up.

"Oh, sorry. Anyways, this is for you, then." Shiro hands the letter over to Rin. "Feel free to take your time reading it."

She opens it up, grabbing the paper inside and silently reading it for a few moments.

...

She sighs. "President..." Then trails off, unsure of what to say.

And then, another moment of silence.

...

"From what the letter says... you must be Shiro-sensei, am I correct?" She then breaks the silence.

*...Sensei?*

"Yeah, Tendou Shiro, that's me." Shiro confirms. "To my left is Tendou Niko, my brother." Her eyes widen a bit when my name was mentioned. What could that be all about...?

"Nice to meet you, miss... Nanagami?" I went ahead and used her last name instead for good measure. She nods in response.

"And then, Hatora Emiya."

"Hm. A pleasure to meet you."

"To my right is Enami Kai..."

"Nice to meet ya, Rin."

"...and lastly, Kantami Nano."

Nano only nods in response.

"Likewise." Rin nods. "My name is Nanagami Rin, current acting president of Kivotos, the academy city." Our eyes widen a bit at the "Academy City" part.

"Wait, 'Academy City'? Then that means..." Kai trails off, awaiting Rin's answer.

"Precisely. Kivotos is comprised of thousands of academies, and is lead by Students."

Our eyes widen even more discovering that information. A city lead by students? Students most likely not even over the age of 18? Interesting...

"Huh... wasn't expecting that answer." Kai responds, surprised.

"And from what the letter contained, it seems you were all sent here by the President as teachers."

...

Wait, hold on.

"Teachers?" I repeat what Rin had just said.

"Yes, but not in the traditional sense." She affirms. "Students are taught through Blu-Ray Disks and combat tapes. Instead of traditional teaching, you will all instead act as 'guides' for them, as a way to lead them to the right direction, as it seems."

"Hmm..." Shiro ponders for a moment. "I see." 

"Y'know, Shiro? I envy you sometimes." Kai starts.

"What?"

"You already know what you're doing. Meanwhile, I feel like an ape that just got dropped off in the middle of nowhere." Weird analogy there, but I get it.

"...hm, my apologies. I understand if this current situation may be very confusing for all of you." Rin apologizes, slightly bowing her head. "However, I need you all to please follow me for now, as there is something I require your help with."

"What is it?" Shiro asks.

"Well... let's just say that it could... determine the very fate of the academy city as a whole." Rin answers.

...

...

...

"...oh, well, this just got more serious than expected." Kai responds after a moment.

"Hmm... alright. Lead the way, Miss Nanagami." Emiya drops the topic, signaling for us to go.

"You do not need to refer to me by my family name, Emiya-sensei." Rin adds before gesturing for us to follow her.

As we walk through the surprisingly large building, we end up in an observation deck, where we all end up seeing a breathtaking wide view of Kivotos.

"Well, then... to formally end the introductions..."

<br>
<br>

<center>"Shiro-sensei,"</center>

<br>

<center>"Niko-sensei,"</center>

<br>

<center>"Kai-sensei,"</center>

<br>

<center>"Emiya-sensei,"</center>

<br>

<center>"and Nano-sensei."</center>

<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>

<center><strong>"Welcome to Kivotos."</strong></center>

<br>

<center><strong>"This is where you will all be working, from now on."</strong></center>

<br>
<br>
<br>

...

"...holy shit."

"Woah..."

"Oh, wow..."

"This is...!"

We all speak in absolute awe, with Nano staying silent, as usual. The sights below aren't doing this city any justice.

A seemingly limitless and clean urban city, and a clear, pure blue sky.

...this is beautiful.

...

"It may be bound to be very different compared to where you all may live, however, something tells me that you all will adapt and do just fine here." Rin breaks the silence.

"Well, as a member of this five-man nomadic group... you won't have to worry." I speak, still taking in the sight.

"That's good." She smiles. "We can leave the rest of the details for later."

"Alright then. Anyways, what's our-" Shiro is suddenly cut off by an elevator ding.

...

"*Oh dear, that might be them.*" I think to myself, remembering the 4 girls at the ground floor.

...

---

///// POV: Shiro /////

Noticing the ding, we all leave the observation deck, heading back to the office lounge. Once we got there, we find four familiar girls waiting. The one in twintails in particular has an annoyed expression.

"Ah! There you are, Acting President! We've all been waiting! Get the real president in here already!" That same girl with the expression is the first to break the silence, clearly angry.

"I've been waiting to see you, Chief Officer." A second girl follows up. As much as we tried, we couldn't help but notice her rather... developed body, and her MASSIVE black wings.

...no, that is not a word mask. Her wings are genuinely massive.

"I'm here to meet with the General Student Council president. The Head Prefect has terms she would like to discuss." A third girl with elf ears in glasses follows up.

"Well... this timing is rather inconvenient." Rin says, her eyes pointed over to the side. Look's like she's also irritated.

Wearing a thinly veiled smile, Rin speaks up.

"Hello. guests that represent neighboring academies' student council, disciplinary boards, and those who otherwise have too much time on their hands."

...I have a feeling that last part is targeted.

"I am well aware why you irksome- I mean, important representatives have come here today." Me and the others suppressed a slight chuckle.

"You're here to blame us for the fuss happening in the Academy City. Isn't that right?" Rin asks, her aura growing more and more menacing by the second.

"If you're well aware, then do something! You represent the General Student Council, after all!" The first girl retorts. "Thousands of academy districts are in panic! Our academy's wind generator shut down just a few days ago!" She follows up.

...did the President really just have a rope on everything?

"There are also rumors that a student under the Federal Corrections Bureau's custody has escaped." The elf girl follows up too.

"There has been a sharp increase in the number of thugs attacking our students on their way to school. Public safety is not being properly enforced." A fourth girl then follows up too. Strange, I didn't notice her there. And is that a single wing on her head...?

"Illegal distribution of tanks, choppers, and other unknown weapons have increased by over 2000 percent. At this rate, ordinary school life in Kivotos will be a thing of the past."

...

...

A-wuh?

Wuh-huh?

Did I just hear that right?

Unknown weapons?

Choppers?

**Tanks?**

***By over 2000 percent!?***

...

...

Holy shit.

"..." Rin stays silent.

"And what is the General Student Council President doing during such a sorry state of affairs? I demand to see her right this instant!" The first girl commands.

Rin sighs, then speaks up again. Is she gonna mention that...?

"The president is not here at the moment. To be frank, she's gone missing." There it is.

"What?!" The first girl gasps in surprise.

"...!" The elf girl says nothing, but her expression clearly shows shock.

"So the rumors were true..." The winged girl confirms.

Rin speaks up once more.

"Allow me to cut to the chase. The General Student Council has no authority because the top administrator of the Sanctum Tower has gone missing."

"We had been searching for a way to bypass the need for verification, all to no avail... until recently."

...I have a feeling.

"You mean you've found a way now, Chief Officer?" The winged girl asks.

"That is correct. Sensei, or rather, the five Senseis here are the answer to our problems." Rin answers simply, pointing to our direction.

...yep, feeling confirmed.

"...?!" The first girl makes a confused noise. Did she not notice us the entire time.

"...!" The elf girl also follows.

"These people?" The winged girl asks, referring to us.

"Wait, us?" Kai asks, confused.

"Hold up. Who are these people you're talking about? What are they doing here in the first place?" The first girl asks.

"Don't ask us or Rin. We're also clueless on how we ended up here." Niko answers. "As for why we're here... well, she can answer that." He quickly follows up.

"Whoever they all are, they don't seem to be from Kivotos." Correct.

"Well, then. Shiro-sensei, would you mind if you all introduced yourselves again?" Rin asks me, or, well, us. 

"Not really, so, here."

I can already hear some writing off Nano's notebook.

"Tendou Shiro. Nice to meet you all." I start.

"Tendou Niko. To repeat what I said to Ayumu: Same sentiment. And yes, me and Shiro are siblings." Niko follows up.

"Hatora Emiya. It's a pleasure to meet you." Then Emiya.

"Enami Kai. Nice to meet y'all." Then Kai, and lastly...

<center><i>Kantami Nano. Nice to meet you all too.</i></center>

<center><i>I use a notebook because my voice doesn't work. Sorry.</i></center>

...Nano. We all gesture to his notebook. 

"Huh?" The first girl stops to read it. "Oh... hey, you don't need to apologize about that!" She exclaims, her tone softening a bit. Nano really does bring out a more gentler side to some people, huh?

The other three read it, and their eyes widen in response. The elf girl in particular showed a bit of empathy.

...gonna assume they haven't experienced talking to mute people before.

"Ahem."

Rin fake-coughs to get our attention again. After that, she speaks up.

"Introductions aside... not only are they going to be teaching in Kivotos, but they've also been personally selected by the General Student Council president."

"Huh? The president chose them? The one who's now missing?" Yeah, we don't know either. "Things are making less and less sense..."

"Well, as Rin said, introductions aside, I repeat, nice to meet you all." I greet the four.

"R-right. It's good to meet you all. I'm Millennium Science School's..." ...Millennium Science? I feel like I've heard of that somewhere before.

"I-I mean, why am I even bothering to introduce myself right now?"

"Don't worry about that annoying girl. Let's just move on..." Rin says with another menacing smile.

"Who are you calling annoying?! I'm Hayase Yuuka! You should remember that name, Sensei!" The first girl, Yuuka, tells us.

"Noted. Well, it's nice to meet you too, Yuuka." I say with a smile.

"Hmm, well then. We should introduce ourselves too." The winged girl mentions.

"Hanekawa Hasumi. Member of the Trinity Justice Task Force. Nice to meet you all." She then starts. So, Hasumi... noted.



"Also, Rin. Can we get details on what exactly we're here for?" Niko asks.

"Ah, yes." She begins.

"You're all here to serve as the advisor for a club that was formed by the General Student Council president."

<center><strong>"The Federal Investigation Club: Schale."</strong></center>

...hmm, federal investigation? That reminded me of the FBI, for some reason.

"This isn't your average club- rather, it is more like a type of extrajudicial organization. Since it's a federal club, you will all be allowed to register students from any of the academies in Kivotos." Oh. That's....

"You're permitted to conduct battle activities in each academy district without restriction." ...

...isn't this a bit too much power for us? We're basically just a bunch of strangers here.

...I have a feeling that President knows a lot more about us than what she's showing here.

"How the president was able to create an organization with this much power, I have no idea." Rin adds.

"The Schale club room is about 30 kilometers from here. The building is currently empty, but we had to put something in the basement at the president's request."

...

Yeah, that President girl knows a lot more than she's letting off.

"It's my job to take you there." Rin then brings out a modern-looking cellphone. "Momoka. I need a helicopter to take us to the Schale club room." She then begins speaking into it...? A radio, perhaps?

Shortly after, a hologram begins to manifest from it. Damn, their technology's advanced this far?

The hologram then shows a short-statured girl with pink hair which looks to also be done in twintails, similar to Yuuka.
