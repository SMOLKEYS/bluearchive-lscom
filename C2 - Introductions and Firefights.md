///// POV: Shiro /////

As we wait for Ayumu and Rin, I couldn't help but wander around in my thoughts for a moment.

*Hmm...*

*If that president girl was the one who brought us here... how? And why?*

*Everything in this city was odd. Bipedal animals, truly sentient robots, and most of all, armed schoolgirls with haloes.*

*A place like this doesn't exist on Earth, so... an alternate universe, perhaps?*

*...*

*Why am I not surprised?*

*...*

*Heh, it probably has something to do with our interest in traveling EVERYWHERE.*

*The idea of visiting different universes was considered intriguing, but absurd and probably impossible in our world. I mean, sure, it COULD be doable, but we would probably be an extinct species long before that can be possible, no thanks to our Oh So Creative way of killing each other.*

*So, most people just set the idea aside. Or, if you're a director, make a movie about it.*

*There's that, and then, there's us five.*

*Normal people on Earth, now in some alternate reality. Something that would be considered absolutely insane and revolutionary.*

*...well, it's either that, or this is some sort of long-ass weird dream that's somehow still cohesive.*

I pinch my cheek. Niko notices me doing that.

"Nope. Not a dream, Shiro." He points out.

"How'd you-" 

"I know you do that whenever we end up stumbling on something utterly stupid or absurd."

"...fair enough."

As I settle my thought process, Ayumu appears from the office doors, probably done talking with Rin.

"Uhm, you may all come in now." Ayumu signals us to come into the office.

"Alright, let's go."

We stand up from the seats we're in, and walk towards the office doors, which Ayumu is holding open.

///// POV: Niko /////

As we step into the office, we're met with the usual cleanliness we've seen almost everywhere. This time, however, there's a girl on the main office table, probably waiting for us. Perhaps this is that "Rin" girl?

Her details are... quite elegant, to say the least. Long, straight jet black hair that almost touches the ground, with dark blue colors on the inner side that gets more saturated as it reaches the bottom, and similarly black bangs on her forehead. Alongside that is their probable standard uniform with gold buttons, and accents. Along her waist is a white belt with golden buckles, holding a pistol hoister.

Though, the most noticeable details are her elf ears and halo, which has a bluish gradient and resembles a crown of sorts.

She certainly gives off an aura of elegance and authoritativeness. Though, at the same time, she seems to be noticeably tired.

Such is the ways of being in a high position, I suppose.
