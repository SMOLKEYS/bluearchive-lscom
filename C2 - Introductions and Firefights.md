///// POV: Shiro /////

As we wait for Ayumu and Rin, I couldn't help but wander around in my thoughts for a moment.

*Hmm...*

*Why do I have a gut feeling that we won't be leaving this city for a while?*

*And why am I not that surprised about it?*

*Eh, it probably has something to do with us just not staying in one location for too long.*

*If I had to find the term for it, we're... "nomadic"?*

*We've been a tight-knit group for a long time now, and we can not just make up our minds on where to formally live.*

*Our longest settlement time for one location was 9 entire months, and it hasn't gone any higher than that for about 5 years now.*

*Sure, we'll revisit some places we've been in, but those don't last very long. Just us passing by, grabbing stuff we may have missed or buying something that place in question has in abundance.*

*God, bless the existence of short-lived jobs. A decent way to earn money without dealing with the constraints of having to stay for too long.*

*...*

*Though...*

*If this city, Kivotos, ends up being possibly our last and longest settlement that we would stay in, by force, or not...*

*...honestly, I wouldn't mind. And knowing the others, they probably also share the same sentiment with me.*

As I settle my thought process, Ayumu appears from the office doors, probably done talking with Rin.

"Uhm, you may all come in now." Ayumu signals us to come into the office.

"Alright."

We stand up from the seats we're in, and walk towards the office doors, which Ayumu is holding open.

///// POV: Niko /////

As we step into the office, we're met with the usual cleanliness we've seen almost everywhere. This time, however, there's a girl on the main office table, probably waiting for us. Perhaps this is that "Rin" girl?

Her details are... quite elegant, to say the least. Long, straight jet black hair that almost touches the ground, with dark blue colors on the inner side that gets more saturated as it reaches the bottom, and similarly black bangs on her forehead. Alongside that is their probable standard uniform with gold buttons, and accents. Along her waist is a white belt with golden buckles, holding a pistol hoister.

Though, the most noticeable details are her elf ears and halo, which has a bluish gradient and resembles a crown of sorts.

She certainly gives off an aura of elegance and authoritativeness, but at the same time, she seems to be noticeably tired.

Such is the ways of being in a high position, I suppose.
