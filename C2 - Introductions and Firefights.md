///// POV: Shiro /////

As we wait for Ayumu and Rin, I couldn't help but wander around in my thoughts for a while.

---

*Hmm...*

*If that president girl was the one who brought us here... how? And why?*

*Everything in this city was odd. Bipedal animals, truly sentient robots, and most of all, armed schoolgirls with haloes.*

*A place like this doesn't exist on Earth, so... an alternate universe, perhaps?*

*...*

*Why am I not surprised?*

*...*

*Heh, probably has something to do with the weird stuff we've seen or have been involved in.*

---

*First, our own home, Earth.*

*We already knew long ago about the various... "quirks" that some people had, but to actually see them in person and even be a part of it is an entire experience on its own.*

*Second, our nomadic lifestyle.*

*For 5 years, we've traveled across the entire globe. We would constantly move around, rest in hotels, or camp if we were outdoors. In that time, we would also gather souvenirs, make various friends, good associates and even learn some languages. It was pretty good, honestly.*

*And lastly, magic. ACTUAL. MAGIC.*

*A few years back, news and headlines appeared of some people suddenly being able to manipulate and control elements and bring up actual magic circles. At first, people were split in between deep intrigue in how it works, and people who were outright calling it fake, saying it was just CGI and referring to science, notably the laws of physics and thermodynamics.*

*Though, their worldview and those said laws would end up being utterly shattered within the span of a month as magic appeared EVERYWHERE, all over the globe with various people being blessed with it. Scientists tried their absolute damnedest to make it make logical sense, but failed. Meanwhile, the ones originally calling it fake were split in two categories:*

*The ones who finally believed it, and the ones who became even more... delusional, for a lack of a better term that I know of. Various conspiracy theories like the waters being drugged by the government to give the illusion of magic, or some sort of invisible drones being used to manipulate elements like fire, or projectors for the magic circles, et cetera.*

*Some people will never fail to amaze me and the others for the lengths they will go to just to deny something.*

*As for us? Well, we didn't have much to say, other than the thought of "well, this was inevitable". It wasn't a matter of IF it would happen, but WHEN. Meanwhile, surprisingly, the government hadn't tried doing anything yet. They acknowledged it, but didn't try doing anything to the people who had it. Whether or not that's out of fear or patience, I'll never know.*

*For a few months, it's just been business as usual. We eat, sleep, travel, sleep, eat, so on and so forth. Though, our routines did give us a chance to actually meet with the magic-bearers.*

*It was certainly interesting and honestly pretty damn cool, to say the least.*

*Eventually though, after a year, the 'blessings' stopped, leaving an estimated total of 15 million people with magical capabilities. During that timespan, new artifacts began to appear around the world, which could boost people's magical capabilities, allow them to utilize new kinds of magic, or even give people who didn't receive magical capabilities to actually use it. Meanwhile, existing ones also received magical power held in them.*

*Though, it wasn't all positives. Some artifacts would actually end up cursing people instead, with one of the worst cases being the Death Touch case, where a person in Europe could kill anything that he physically touched, except himself. Plant, animal, human, it didn't matter. Plants would wilt and rot immediately, while animals and humans would have their hearts and brain activity INSTANTLY stop, collapsing and ending their life then and there.*

*Unfortunately, he didn't last very long, as he would be found dead by suicide just a week after receiving the curse. Poor guy.*

*Though, anyways. Other than the dark cases, everything was, as I said, business as usual. Well, up until the last day of the magic drops.*

*Imagine our surprise when Nano ended up being one of the last 100 people to receive magical capabilities. Now imagine our surprise again when it was found out that his capabilities were amplified far, FAR higher than anyone elses.*

*...*

*...oh wait, I went FAR off track there, did I?*

*Well, to make a long story short: Shit has happened in our world, and it made us desensitized to most surprising things.*

*Honestly, am I just in a long-ass dream, or...*

---

I pinch my cheek. Niko notices me doing that.

"Nope. Not a dream, Shiro." He points out.

"How'd you-" 

"I know you do that whenever we end up stumbling on something utterly stupid or absurd."

"...fair enough."

As I settle my long thought process, Ayumu appears from the office doors, probably done talking with Rin.

"Uhm, you may all come in now." Ayumu signals us to come into the office.

"Alright, let's go."

We stand up from the seats we're in, and walk towards the office doors, which Ayumu is holding open.

---

///// POV: Niko /////

As we step into the office, we're met with the usual cleanliness we've seen almost everywhere. This time, however, there's a girl on the main office table, probably waiting for us. Perhaps this is that "Rin" girl?

Her details are... quite elegant, to say the least. Long, straight jet black hair that almost touches the ground, with dark blue colors on the inner side that gets more saturated as it reaches the bottom, and similarly black bangs on her forehead. Alongside that is their probable standard uniform with gold buttons, and accents. Along her waist is a white belt with golden buckles, holding a pistol hoister.

Though, the most noticeable details are her elf ears and halo, which has a bluish gradient and resembles a crown of sorts.

She certainly gives off an aura of elegance and authoritativeness. Though, at the same time, she seems to be noticeably tired.

Such is the ways of being in a high position, I suppose.

"Hmm... you must be the ones the President sent, am I correct?" She guesses.

"And I assume you must be this 'Rin-chan' girl this letter was mentioning." Shiro mentions, holding the letter. Looks like both our guesses were correct, seeing her reaction to the nickname.

"...please refrain from calling me by that name." She quickly follows up.

"Oh, sorry. Anyways, this is for you, then." Shiro hands the letter over to Rin. "Feel free to take your time reading it."

She opens it up, grabbing the paper inside and silently reading it for a few moments.

...

She sighs. "President..." Then trails off, unsure of what to say.

And then, another moment of silence.

...

"From what the letter says... you must be Shiro-sensei, am I correct?" She then breaks the silence.

*...Sensei?*

"Yeah, Tendou Shiro, that's me." Shiro confirms. "To my left is Tendou Niko, my brother." Her eyes widen a bit when my name was mentioned. What could that be all about...?

"Nice to meet you, miss... Nanagami?" I went ahead and used her last name instead for good measure. She nods in response.

"And then, Hatora Emiya."

"Hm. A pleasure to meet you."

"To my right is Enami Kai..."

"Nice to meet ya, Rin."

"...and lastly, Kantami Nano."

Nano only nods in response.

"Likewise." Rin nods. "My name is Nanagami Rin, current acting president of Kivotos, the academy city." Our eyes widen a bit at the "Academy City" part.

"Wait, 'Academy City'? Then that means..." Kai trails off, awaiting Rin's answer.

"Precisely. Kivotos is comprised of thousands of academies, and is lead by Students."

Our eyes widen even more discovering that information. A city lead by students? Students most likely not even over the age of 18? Interesting...

"Huh... wasn't expecting that answer." Kai responds, surprised.

"And from what the letter contained, it seems you were all sent here by the President as teachers."

...

Wait, hold on.

"Teachers?" I repeat what Rin had just said.

"Yes, but not in the traditional sense." She affirms. "Students are taught through Blu-Ray Disks and combat tapes. Instead of traditional teaching, you will all instead act as 'guides' for them, as a way to lead them to the right direction, as it seems."

"Hmm..." Shiro ponders for a moment. "I see." 

"Y'know, Shiro? I envy you sometimes." Kai starts.

"What?"

"You already know what you're doing. Meanwhile, I feel like an ape that just got dropped off in the middle of nowhere." Weird analogy there, but I get it.

"...hm, my apologies. I understand if this current situation may be very confusing for all of you." Rin apologizes, slightly bowing her head. "However, I need you all to please follow me for now, as there is something I require your help with."

"What is it?" Shiro asks.

"Well... let's just say that it could... determine the very fate of the academy city as a whole." Rin answers.

...

...

...

"...oh, well, this just got more serious than expected." Kai responds after a moment.

"Hmm... alright. Lead the way, Miss Nanagami." Emiya drops the topic, signaling for us to go.

"You do not need to refer to me by my family name, Emiya-sensei." Rin adds before gesturing for us to follow her.

As we walk through the surprisingly large building, we end up in an observation deck, where we all end up seeing a breathtaking wide view of Kivotos.

"Well, then... to formally end the introductions..."

<br>
<br>

<center>"Shiro-sensei,"</center>

<br>

<center>"Niko-sensei,"</center>

<br>

<center>"Kai-sensei,"</center>

<br>

<center>"Emiya-sensei,"</center>

<br>

<center>"and Nano-sensei."</center>

<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>

<center><strong>"Welcome to Kivotos."</strong></center>

<br>

<center><strong>"This is where you will all be working, from now on."</strong></center>

<br>
<br>
<br>

...

Nano stares at the view in awe.

"...holy shit."

"Woah..."

"Oh, wow..."

"This is...!"

We all speak in absolute awe. The sights below aren't doing this city any justice.

A seemingly limitless and clean urban city, and a clear, pure blue sky.

...this is beautiful.

...

"It may be bound to be very different compared to where you all may live, however, something tells me that you all will adapt and do just fine here." Rin breaks the silence.

"Well, as a member of this five-man nomadic group... you won't have to worry." I speak, still taking in the sight.

"That's good." She smiles. "We can leave the rest of the details for later."

"Alright then. Anyways, what's our-" Shiro is suddenly cut off by an elevator ding.

"*Oh dear, that might be them.*" I think to myself.

...

///// POV: Shiro /////

Noticing the ding, we all leave the observation deck, heading back to the office lounge. Once we got there, we find four familiar girls waiting. One in particular has an annoyed expression.
