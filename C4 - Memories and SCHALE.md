"Heh heh... those lil' goofs are gonna love this." I muse to myself, setting down the pot of beef stew I personally made.

*Plates, check... cutlery, check, and... that's all!*

With the table good to go, I begin calling the four.

"Guys! Time for lunch!" I shout out as usual.

"Yeeees!" And as usual, Shiro is the first to respond to my call, his usual enthusiastic voice breaking through the calm noise of the AC unit.
