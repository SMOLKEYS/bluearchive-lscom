///// POV: c2hpbG9oCg\=\= ///// <> ///// The Orphanage /////

"Heh heh... those lil' goofs are gonna love this." I muse to myself, setting down the pot of beef stew I personally made.

*Plates, check... cutlery, check, and... that's all!*

With the table good to go, I begin calling the five kids.

"Guys! Time for lunch!" I shout out as usual.

"Yeeees!" And as usual, Shiro is the first to respond to my call, his usual enthusiastic voice breaking through the calm noise of the AC unit.

"Woahh! It smells yummy!" Then, Kai is second to speak up. I hear their footsteps run on the wooden floor of the orphanage lounge.

"Be careful, you might trip on the way!" I speak out.

After a moment, the door leading outside opens, and Shiro is the first to pop out from it.

The others- Niko, Emiya, Kai and Nano- follow up shortly after.

"Hmm~" I hum as I walk up to them. I pat their heads one by one. "What were ya'll doing out there? You look messy again." I ask the small ones.

"Uhm... we were on the playground..." Niko responds reluctantly.

"Hmm~ I see! Hey, don't worry, I ain't mad!" I respond back, patting Niko's head. "Well, for now, wash your hands so we can finally start eating." I say, letting go of Niko's head.

"**Umami**-sama, what's for lunch?" Emiya asks me.

"Heh heh... you'll see soon. I made it myself this time!" I proudly declare.

"Ehhh..." He trails off, remembering the *god awful* times I miserably failed those cooking attempts, with them being the most unfortunate victims of my actions.

"Waaaah! Don't give me that again! It's good this time! One more chance! Promise!" I cry out to him. I already broke that promise multiple times, but this time I mean it!

"...promise?" He asks me.

"Promise!" I answer a bit too enthusiastically. "Now c'mon, go wash your hands. Also, it's not Umami-sama, it's **Shiloh**-sama!" I follow up.
