The official upstream repository for [this particular fanfic](https://archiveofourown.org/works/62896948). Everything is done under the [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) app and uploaded here through the app's "Git" community extension.

Updated every so often.

# Warning

If you haven't read the warning on the Ao3 page, reading the fic through here can be *very* inconsistent, as parts will most likely go through multiple rewrites, possibly causing confusion on the story and lore.

Most HTML tags that Ao3 can render fine may not work correctly under GitHub Markdown, making some text look weird and uncentered.
