///// POV: Shiro ///// <> ///// 29.7KM to Sanctum Tower /////

Bullets whizz all around us as we make our way to the Sanctum Tower, with various delinquents and sukebans (as the group called them) blocking our way, stopping us from getting there. Hasumi, Chinatsu me and the other 4 stay behind, while Suzumi and Yuuka take the frontlines.

So far, our current formation is working relatively well; Hasumi and Chinatsu stay behind to provide heavy-hitting firepower and healing support if needed, while Suzumi stays somewhat close to us to provide extra firepower and disorient the enemies with her flashbangs, which then gives Yuuka the opportunity to gun them down with her dual-wield SMGs, which are apparently named "Logic" and "Reason".

...I feel like I now know why she had an extreme reaction towards magic compared to the others. As far as I'm concerned, science and magic do *not* mix well, or at all.

As for me and the other 4, we're all currently laying low since we have no haloes, which apparently just turns these girls into literal superhumans, boosting their strength significantly and giving them *bullet resistance*, which lets them tank and shrug off most bullets. *So that's why guns just existed everywhere...*

---

*Haloes. A common element that ALL Kivotos students have.*

*As we made our way to the Sanctum Tower, Rin, Yuuka and Chinatsu gave us information on what they're for. Apparently, as far as they're concerned, it has existed for as long as they can remember.*

*They provide students with immense physical power and bullet resistance, which lets them tank bullets of all kinds and even explosives, though they still can get injured. Some students can also develop their halo further, giving them more strength or amplifying their current abilities.*

*And after some extra explanations from Chinatsu, I concluded that haloes have three different states:*

*First: Active, which basically indicates that a student is currently awake. Their halo is fully visible, and can be used to see if they're faking being asleep or unconscious.*

*Second: Inactive, which is when a student is actually unconscious, whether from sleeping or tanking too much damage in a firefight. At this state, their halo isn't visible.*

*And lastly, an incredibly rare and dark one: Shattered. This is considered a dark one, since this indicates that a student has been effectively KILLED, leaving behind fragments of the destroyed halo that eventually disappears, and the body of the dead student.*

*Apparently, deaths are incredibly rare in Kivotos, whether that'd be among the students, animal-people or automatons. But, there have been some reported cases. These only occur when a student sustains way too much damage that even their halo can't keep up with, or through something so strong it can bypass the protection the halo gives, leaving them fatally injured.*

*There is nothing about the third state that I like. For god's sake, they're NOT even adults yet! They still have their youthful lives that they haven't fully experienced yet! And even if they were already adults, an early death is NOT something they should have!*

*...*

*...oh, god damn it, going off-track again...*

*Anyways, basically: Student or not, death is NOT something they deserve. Not NOW, not TODAY, not EVER. End of story.*

"Yuuka! You doing okay over there?!" I shout towards her direction.

"So far so good! My barrier's holding up for a lot longer than usual thanks to Nano, which is helping!" She shouts back, tanking enemy fire with her calculator barrier, aptly called "Q.E.D", which Nano is repairing.

"...hmm, is your magic control fine, Nano?" Emiya asks Nano, to which he nods in response. "I see..."

For now, we haven't tried out using Nano's magic for attacking, and have only been using it to constantly repair Yuuka's barrier. We aren't taking any chances on its stability for offensive attacks, or for the safety of the enemies. At the end of the day, they're still students like Yuuka, Hasumi, Chinatsu, Suzumi... and perhaps even Rin.

...this world is strange.

///// POV: Emiya ///// <> ///// 23.3KM to Sanctum Tower /////

"Enemy with an RPG hiding behind that smoking vehicle!" I point out to Hasumi.

"Got it." She nods in response. Reloading her weapon, she then fires a bullet charged with some sort of energy, striking the delinquent square on the head, knocking them out immediately.

"*Hmm... are their haloes improving and strengthening their capabilities?*" I think to myself. "*Also, to hit a clean shot to the forehead at such a distance...*"

"Hm. Impressive aim." I say somewhat offhandedly, realizing she managed to strike a headshot on a target a fair distance away with a scopeless rifle.

"This is nothing compared to my typical work in Trinity, but regardless... thank you for the compliment." She responds back, her cheeks slightly dusted pink.

---

///// POV: Helmeted Delinquent A ///// <> ///// 17.5KM to Sanctum Tower /////

"*Damn it! How are they tearing down our forces so easily?! It's literally HUNDREDS to FOUR! HOW?!*"

"*Also, why won't that damned Millennium student's shield break?! We've been gunning it down for so long now! It even tanked THREE damn RPG rounds! Surely that would have been enough to break most shields, right?!*"

As I continue shooting at the four opposing forces destroying our group, I notice something floating besides that huge Trinity student with a rifle. It looks like... a blue orb?

"*...okay, now what the hell is that supposed to be now?*"

"*...huh, it turned red? Wait, it's getting bigger, too.*"

...wait, no.

"*HUH?! IT"S HEADING STRAIGHT FOR ME-*"

***BOOOOOOOOM***

I get violently interrupted as it explodes in front of my face, launching me and the others back.

"..."

"...what... the fuck... was *that*....?"

---

///// POV: Shiro /////

"Ah..." I trail off, staring at the aftermath of Nano's orb explosion. "That... worked out."

"This silence... is fucking painful." Kai mutters, noticing that everyone has just completely stopped fighting after the orb exploded.

Nano just stands where he is, and like the others at the moment, eyes wide and mouth agape.

*...I don't think he, or literally everyone else, was expecting that.*

"...hm, I think 'Rocket Orb' was too much." Emiya realizes.

"*You* suggested that to Nano? How do you even know it exists?" Niko asks Emiya.

"I found out about it while talking to a magic-explosives expert back on Earth." He answers.

"Alright..." Niko trails off.

Meanwhile, Nano shifts his attention to us, a desperate "*Wil she be okay???*" on his face.

"Yeah, she'll probably be fine... probably." I answer, unsure myself. "Anyways..."

---

///// POV: Shiro ///// <> ///// 4.4KM to Sanctum Tower /////

"Area clear!" I shout out, eyeing the area for any remaining stragglers. Fortunately, that seems to be all of them.

*Not often does one see a street strewn with unconscious delinquents and loaded weapons...*

*...is that an M1 Garand?*

"The Sanctum Tower is close by. Just an estimated... four more kilometers until we reach it." Hasumi points out.

With the tower close, me and the other 4 take a good look at it.

"Woah..." I say in awe while the other 4 stay silent. Amongst all the buildings we've seen, the Sanctum Tower stands as the tallest one. There looks to also be some sort of pillar at the top (and a *bright* glow seperating it from the tower), surrounded by floating panels on the base, and is somehow extending *even* higher up, reaching past the sky haloes. Actually, hold on, it looks like the haloes come *from* the tower itself.

...

"Say, do the sky haloes come from the tower itself?" Kai breaks the brief silence, leaving a question open for anyone.

"We aren't exactly sure... to be honest, no one in Kivotos actually knows when, how and why the Sanctum Tower was constructed, nor how it somehow has a sort of... leash on every major component on most schools, such as Millennium's wind generators." Yuuka picks up on it and gives an answer.

"Huh, that's... strange."

*Rin did mention that the president was the top administrator for this tower... yeah, that checks out.*

*...it hasn't even been a third of the day since we arrived, and somehow I'm already getting used to whatever mysteries she left behind.*

Setting my thoughts aside, I suddenly receive a call from Rin from this little drone she gave us. I pick it up, and throw the drone upwards. It stabilizes, and starts bringing her hologram into view.

"Rin? What's up?" I ask.

"Shiro-sensei, please gather everyone around." She commands with a bit of emergency in her tone.

"Huh? Well, alright then." Looks like something came up.  "Guys! Gather around me! Rin has something to report!" I shout out to the group, and they begin to move towards me.

"What is it?" Yuuka asks.

"We've just received reports that one of the Seven Prisoners in the Corrections Bureau is currently at the Sanctum Tower." Rin reports.

"Seriously?! Who is it?" Yuuka asks, uneasy.

"Could it be that escaped Corrections Bureau student that Momoka mentioned?" I ask.

"Precisely. She is known by her identity, the 'Fox of Calamity', and by the name of Kosaka Wakamo."

"Huh?! *That* Fox of Calamity?!" Yuuka shouts out indignantly.

"Can we get any details about her?" Emiya inquires.

"Well, as her identity suggests, she is notorious for being a whirlwind of chaos, bringing destruction against everything in her path. The core parts of her identity are her mask, which she rarely takes off, and as was mentioned, her destructive tendencies." Rin, ignoring Yuuka, answers.

"Hmm, noted. Anything else we need to know?" I ask.

"Those should be everything you need, but please attempt to avoid contact with her, as she is difficult to stop." She warns.

"Got it. Though, if that doesn't work..." I trail off.

"...we might have to utilize Nano's magic again." Kai continues.

"Hmm?"

"Oh yeah, almost forgot to mention this, but we've started joining the others in direct firefights with Nano's magic." I follow up.

"I see. I presume it can now be considered stable enough for attacking?" Rin asks.

"Yeah. It's helping out by a *massive* margin, and hasn't gone unstable the entire time." I answer.

Actually, hold on...

"Wait. Nano, you doing okay?" I ask, *just* remembering that his magic capacity isn't unlimited. He nods in response. "Alright, good."

"Is something wrong?" Chinatsu asks.

"Just remembered that stored magic isn't necessarily unlimited." I answer.

"Wasn't it mentioned that Nano's magic capacity is higher than everyone else's by an order of magnitude?" Kai questions.

"I remember that clear as day, but we've never had to use it to *this* extent." I follow up.

"Fair enough." Kai concludes. "Also, Rin, anything else to take note of?"

"Well, other than the Fox of Calamity, there shouldn't be anything else to deal with now." She answers.

"Alright then, we're cutting the connection now." I say.

"Understood. I'll be there once control over the tower has been regained. Best of luck to everyone." Rin concludes before I cut the connection.

"Haah... as if this wasn't chaotic enough, now we also have to deal with that fox..." Yuuka groans.

"Well... we don't have much of a choice now. It's either luck or strength that'll get us through." Emiya says.

"That's that then. Everyone ready to go one last time?"
<br>
---

"Always ready."

"Good to go."

"Locked and loaded."

Nano nods.

---

"Ready to go, Sensei."

Yuuka sighs. "Well, no other choice left... yeah, I'm ready."

"Mm." Chinatsu nods.

"Flashbangs... check. Ready to go too, Shiro-sensei."

---
<br>
<center>"Alright. One final stretch, here we go!"</center>
<br>

---

///// POV: Nano //// <> ///// 1KM to Sanctum Tower /////

I stay crouched behind a destroyed car, waiting for their go-to signal.

"Yuuka, attackers by your right!" Shiro shouts out. "And Suzumi, throw a flashbang towards the sniper duo behind that smoking car!" He follows up quickly.

"Got it!"/"Alright, flashbang going out!" Yuuka and Suzumi respond at the same time, with Yuuka gunning down the incoming attackers, and Suzumi throwing a flashbang to the noted sniper duo.

*She can throw that really far, actually...*

"Hasumi! Another delinquent with an RPG by that wall!" Emiya points out.

*...that still doesn't sit right with me...*

"Target spotted." Hasumi then strikes down the RPG-carrying delinquent. Though-

*BOOOOOOM*

-the bullet ends up striking the loaded RPG itself, making it explode in the delinquent's hands.

*Oh... that's gotta hurt...*

"Large groups incoming up-front! Nano, you're good to go!" Niko signals me to retaliate.

*Alright, I'll do my best...!*

Shifting my attention back to the staff. I begin to manifest offensive magic again.

<center><strong>[ 'ROCKET ORB' 3X ]</strong></center>

Three orbs begin manifesting beside me, their color a beautiful sky-blue.

<center><strong>[ 'FRONT BARRIER' ]</strong></center>

I then prepare a barrier, since this will need me to be visible to the others.

*One...*

*Two...*

*...THREE!*

The orbs begin to shift to a red color, as it does that, I stand, now visible to the enemies. Their attention shifts to me, or more precisely, the orbs.

<center><strong>[ 'PERCEPTION BOOST' ]</strong></center>

...I feel time slow down around me, and I feel my senses heighten. Using it to my advantage, I scan the group.

*Three large groups... looks like some of them know what the orbs are...*

I think to myself, noticing the fear in some of their eyes.

*Target that one... here... and... THERE!*

I designate a trajectory for each orb to strike. Then, taking a deep breath...

*SWOOSH*

...I slash my staff forward, signaling the orbs to strike. At the same time, I drop my perception boost, restoring time back to normal speed.

"Huh?! Wait, EVERYONE, GET AWA-" One of the delinquents tries warning the others, while some point their guns at me-

*BOOOOOOOOOOOM*

-but to no avail, as the three orbs strike down each group in unison, exploding and instantly knocking them all out.

...

The battleground goes silent again.

"Holy... shit..." Kai breaks the silence, aghast at what just occurred.

The remaining delinquents stare at the aftermath, then back at me with visible fear in some of them.

"S-shit, screw this! Fall back! NOW!" One of them shouts in fear, running away. The others instantly follow suite, horrified that their massive group was quickly dealt with.

"N-nope! Nope! Not dealing with *that*!"

"Please spare me, please spare me, please spare me!!!" 

"I knew I shouldn't have been a part of this!"

With the delinquents scattering away, again, silence.

...

"Uhhh... do we keep going?" Kai asks.

"...yeah." Shiro answers after a short delay. Meanwhile, the four girls are completely stunned.

"You four doing okay?" Emiya asks the girls.

"...don't you dare forget about the explanation." Yuuka answers.

"...noted." He concludes.

"That was... something."

Recovering from the stunlock, we begin the last trek to the tower.
