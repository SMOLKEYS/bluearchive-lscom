///// POV: Shiro ///// <> ///// 29.7KM to Sanctum Tower /////

Bullets whizz all around us as we make our way to the Sanctum Tower, with various delinquents and sukebans (as the group called them) blocking our way, stopping us from getting there. Hasumi, Chinatsu, me and the other 4 stay behind, while Suzumi and Yuuka take the frontlines.

So far, our current formation is working relatively well; Hasumi and Chinatsu stay behind to provide heavy-hitting firepower and healing support if needed, while Suzumi stays somewhat close to us to provide extra firepower and disorient the enemies with her flashbangs, which then gives Yuuka the opportunity to gun them down with her dual-wield SMGs, which are apparently named "Logic" and "Reason".

...I feel like I now know why she had an extreme reaction towards magic compared to the others. As far as I'm concerned, science and magic do *not* mix well, or at all.

As for me and the other 4, we're all currently laying low since we have no haloes, which apparently just turns these girls into literal superhumans, boosting their strength significantly and giving them *bullet resistance*, which lets them tank and shrug off most bullets. *So that's why guns just existed everywhere...*

---

*Haloes. A common element that ALL Kivotos students have.*

*As we made our way to the Sanctum Tower, Rin, Yuuka and Chinatsu gave us information on what they're for. Apparently, as far as they're concerned, it has existed for as long as they can remember.*

*They provide students with immense physical power and bullet resistance, which lets them tank bullets of all kinds and even explosives, though they still can get injured. Some students can also develop their halo further, giving them more strength or amplifying their current abilities.*

*And after some extra explanations from Chinatsu, I concluded that haloes have three different states:*

*First: Active, which basically indicates that a student is currently awake. Their halo is fully visible, and can be used to see if they're faking being asleep or unconscious.*

*Second: Inactive, which is when a student is actually unconscious, whether from sleeping or tanking too much damage in a firefight. At this state, their halo isn't visible.*

*And lastly, an incredibly rare and dark one: Shattered. This is considered a dark one, since this indicates that a student has been effectively KILLED, leaving behind fragments of the destroyed halo that eventually disappears, and the body of the dead student.*

*Apparently, deaths are incredibly rare in Kivotos, whether that'd be among the students, animal-people or automatons. But, there have been some reported cases. These only occur when a student sustains way too much damage that even their halo can't keep up with, or through something so strong it can bypass the protection the halo gives, leaving them fatally injured.*

*There is nothing about the third state that I like. For god's sake, they're NOT even adults yet! They still have their youthful lives that they haven't fully experienced yet! And even if they were already adults, an early death is NOT something they should have!*

*...*

*...oh, god damn it, going off-track again...*

*Anyways, basically: Student or not, death is NOT something they deserve. Not NOW, not TODAY, not EVER. End of story.*

"Yuuka! You doing okay over there?!" I shout towards her direction.

"So far so good! My barrier's holding up for a lot longer than usual thanks to Nano-sensei, which is helping!" She shouts back, tanking enemy fire with her calculator barrier, aptly called "Q.E.D", which Nano is repairing.

"...hmm, is your magic control fine, Nano?" Emiya asks Nano, to which he nods in response. "I see..."

For now, we haven't tried out using Nano's magic for attacking, and have only been using it to constantly repair Yuuka's barrier. We aren't taking any chances on its stability for offensive attacks, or for the safety of the enemies. At the end of the day, they're still students like Yuuka, Hasumi, Chinatsu, Suzumi... and perhaps even Rin.

...this world is strange.

---

///// POV: Emiya ///// <> ///// 23.3KM to Sanctum Tower /////

"Enemy with an RPG hiding behind that smoking vehicle!" I point out to Hasumi.

"Got it." She nods in response. Reloading her weapon, she then fires a bullet charged with some sort of energy, striking the delinquent square on the head, knocking them out immediately.

"*Hmm... are their haloes improving and strengthening their capabilities?*" I think to myself. "*Also, to hit a clean shot to the forehead at such a distance...*"

"Hm. Impressive aim." I say somewhat offhandedly, realizing she managed to strike a headshot on a target a fair distance away with a scopeless rifle.

"This is nothing compared to my typical work in Trinity, but regardless... thank you for the compliment." She responds back, her cheeks slightly dusted pink.

---

///// POV: Luna ///// <> ///// 17.5KM to Sanctum Tower /////

"*Damn it! How are they tearing down our forces so easily?! It's literally HUNDREDS to FOUR! HOW?!*"

"*Also, why won't that damned Millennium student's shield break?! We've been gunning it down for so long now! It even tanked THREE damn RPG rounds! Surely that would have been enough to break most shields, right?!*"

As I continue shooting at the four opposing forces destroying our group, I notice something floating besides that huge Trinity student with a rifle. It looks like... a blue orb?

"*...okay, now what the hell is that supposed to be?*"

"*...huh, it turned red? Wait, it's shaking, too.*"

...wait.

"*HUH?! IT"S HEADING STRAIGHT FOR ME-*"

***BOOOOOOOOM***

I get violently interrupted as it explodes in front of my face, launching me and the others near me away.

"..."

"...what... the fuck... was *that*....?"

---

///// POV: Shiro /////

"Ah..." I trail off, staring at the aftermath of Nano's orb explosion. "That... worked out."

"This silence... is fucking painful." Kai mutters, noticing that everyone has just completely stopped fighting after the orb exploded.

Nano just stands where he is, and like the others at the moment, eyes wide and mouth agape.

*...I don't think he, or literally everyone else, was expecting that.*

"...hm, I think 'Rocket Orb' was too much." Emiya realizes.

"*You* suggested that to Nano? How do you even know it exists?" Niko asks Emiya.

"I found out about it while talking to a magic-explosives expert back on Earth." He answers.

"Alright..." Niko trails off.

Meanwhile, Nano shifts his attention to us, a desperate "*Wil she be okay???*" on his face.

"Yeah, she'll probably be fine... probably." I answer, unsure myself. "Anyways..."

---

///// POV: Shiro ///// <> ///// 4.4KM to Sanctum Tower /////

"Area clear!" I shout out, eyeing the area for any remaining stragglers. Fortunately, that seems to be all of them.

*Not often does one see a street strewn with unconscious delinquents and loaded weapons...*

*...is that an M1 Garand?*

"The Sanctum Tower is close by. Just an estimated... four more kilometers until we reach it." Hasumi points out.

With the tower close, me and the other 4 take a good look at it.

"Woah..." I say in awe while the other 4 stay silent. Amongst all the buildings we've seen, the Sanctum Tower stands as the tallest one. There looks to also be some sort of pillar at the top (and a *bright* glow seperating it from the tower), surrounded by floating panels on the base, and is somehow extending *even* higher up, reaching past the sky haloes. Actually, hold on, it looks like the haloes come *from* the tower itself.

...

"Say, do the sky haloes come from the tower itself?" Kai breaks the brief silence, leaving a question open for anyone.

"We aren't exactly sure... to be honest, no one in Kivotos actually knows when, how and why the Sanctum Tower was constructed, nor how it somehow has a sort of... leash on every major component on most schools, such as Millennium's wind generators." Yuuka picks up on it and gives an answer.

"Huh, that's... strange."

*Rin did mention that the president was the top administrator for this tower... yeah, that checks out.*

*...it hasn't even been a third of the day since we arrived, and somehow I'm already getting used to whatever mysteries she left behind.*

Setting my thoughts aside, I suddenly receive a call from Rin on this little drone she gave us. I pick it up, and throw the drone upwards. It stabilizes, and starts bringing her hologram into view.

"Rin? What's up?" I ask.

"Shiro-sensei, please gather everyone around." She commands with a bit of emergency in her tone.

"Huh? Well, alright then." Looks like something came up.  "Guys! Gather around me! Rin has something to report!" I shout out to the group, and they begin to move towards me.

"What is it?" Yuuka asks.

"We've just received reports that one of the Seven Prisoners in the Corrections Bureau is currently at the Sanctum Tower." Rin reports.

"Seriously?! Who is it?" Yuuka asks, uneasy.

"Could it be that escaped Corrections Bureau student that Momoka girl mentioned?" I ask.

"Precisely. She is known by her identity, the 'Fox of Calamity', and by the name of Kosaka Wakamo."

"...!" Hasumi, Chinatsu and Suzumi react silently.

"Huh?! *That* Fox of Calamity?!" Yuuka shouts out in surprise.

"Can we get any details about her?" Emiya inquires.

"Well, as her identity suggests, she is notorious for being a whirlwind of chaos, bringing destruction against everything in her path. The core parts of her identity are her mask, which she rarely takes off, and as was mentioned, her destructive tendencies." Rin, ignoring Yuuka, answers.

"Hmm, noted. Anything else we need to know?" I ask.

"Those should be everything you need, but please attempt to avoid contact with her, as she is difficult to stop." She warns.

"Got it. Though, if that doesn't work..." I trail off.

"...we might have to utilize Nano's magic again." Kai continues.

"Hmm?"

"Oh yeah, almost forgot to mention this, but we've started joining the others in direct firefights with Nano's magic." I follow up.

"I see. I presume it can now be considered stable enough for retaliating?" Rin asks.

"Yeah. It's helping out by a *massive* margin, and hasn't gone unstable the entire time." I answer.

Actually, hold on...

"Wait a second... hey, Nano, you doing okay?" I ask, *just* remembering that his magic capacity isn't unlimited. He turns his head in confusion, but nods in response shortly after. "Alright, good."

"Is something wrong?" Chinatsu asks.

"Just remembered that his stored magic isn't necessarily unlimited." I answer.

"Uh, but wasn't it mentioned that his magic capacity is higher than everyone else's by an order of magnitude?" Kai questions.

"I remember that clear as day, but we've never had to use it to *this* extent." I follow up.

"Fair enough." Kai concludes. "Also, Rin, anything else to take note of?"

"Well, other than the Fox of Calamity, there shouldn't be anything else to deal with now." She answers.

"Alright then, we're cutting the connection now." I say.

"Understood. I'll be there once control over the tower has been regained. Be careful, and best of luck to everyone." Rin concludes before I cut the connection.

"Haah... as if this wasn't chaotic enough, now we also have to deal with that fox..." Yuuka groans.

"Well... we don't have much of a choice now. It's either luck or strength that'll get us through." Emiya says.

"Also, Shiro-sensei, I've been meaning to ask, but you, Emiya-sensei, Kai-sensei and Niko-sensei don't have magic?" Chinatsu inquires.

"Nope, no magic in us. I'll add this to the explanation once we reclaim Sanctum, but to make a long story short: Back in our place, 15 million people all around the globe were given magical capabilities over a year. Nano was one of the last 100 to receive it on the last day, but his was far, *far* more powerful than anyone else's." I answer.

"I see..." Chinatsu trails off, thinking about it.

"Well, as I said: Save the questions for when the magic explanation is due. Everyone ready to go one last time?"
<br>

---

"Always ready."

"Good to go."

"Locked and loaded."

Nano nods.

---

"Ready to go, Sensei."

Yuuka sighs. "Well, no other choice left... yeah, I'm ready."

"Mm." Chinatsu nods.

"Flashbangs... check. Ready to go too, Shiro-sensei."

---
<br>
<center>"Alright. One final stretch, here we go!"</center>
<br>

---

///// POV: Nano //// <> ///// 1KM to Sanctum Tower /////

I stay crouched behind a destroyed car, waiting for their go-to signal.

"Yuuka, attackers by your right!" Shiro shouts out. "And Suzumi, throw a flashbang towards the sniper duo behind that smoking car!" He follows up quickly.

"Got it!"/"Alright, flashbang going out!" Yuuka and Suzumi respond at the same time, with Yuuka gunning down the incoming attackers, and Suzumi throwing a flashbang to the noted sniper duo.

*She can throw that really far, actually...*

"Hasumi! Another delinquent with an RPG by that wall!" Emiya points out.

*...that still doesn't sit right with me...*

"Target spotted." Hasumi then strikes down the RPG-carrying delinquent. Though-

*BOOOOOOM*

-the bullet ends up striking the loaded RPG itself, making it explode in the delinquent's hands.

*Oh... that's gotta hurt...*

"Large groups incoming up-front! Nano, you're good to go!" Niko signals me to retaliate.

*Alright, I'll do my best...!*

Shifting my attention back to the staff. I begin to manifest offensive magic again.

<center><strong>[ 'ROCKET ORB' 3X ]</strong></center>

Three orbs escape the staff's core, their color a beautiful sky-blue.

<center><strong>[ 'FRONT BARRIER' ]</strong></center>

Utilizing a defense skill that Niko told me, I then prepared a magic barrier, since this will need me to be visible to the enemies.

*Alright... just big enough to keep me safe. Now...*

*One...*

*Two...*

*...THREE!*

The orbs begin to shift to a red color, as it does that, I stand, now visible to the enemies. Their attention shifts to me, or more precisely, the orbs.

Then, with a skill I personally found myself...

<center><strong>[ 'PERCEPTION BOOST' ]</strong></center>

...I feel time slow down significantly, and my senses heighten. Using it to my advantage, I scan the group.

"Shit! Guys, shoot.... th....ose..... o....rb........s......!" One of the delinquents notices the orbs, but calls out too late as her voice slows down.

*Three large groups... looks like some of them know what the orbs are...*

I think to myself, noticing the fear in some of their eyes.

*Target that one... here... and... THERE!*

I designate a trajectory for each orb to strike. Then, taking a deep breath...

*SWOOSH*

...I slash my staff forward, signaling the orbs to strike. At the same time, I drop my perception boost, restoring time back to normal speed.

"Huh?! SHIT! EVERYONE, GET AWA-" That same delinquent, noticing the orbs shaking, tries warning the others, while some point their guns at me-

*BOOOOOOOOOOOM*

-but to no avail, as the three orbs strike down each group in unison, exploding at full force (well, up until the skill's current upper limit, at least) and instantly knocking them all out.

...

The battleground goes silent again.

---

*Ah... well, uh... that was...*

"Holy... shit..." Kai breaks the silence, aghast at what just occurred. 

The remaining delinquents stare at the aftermath, then back at me with visible fear in some of them.

"S-shit, screw this! Fall back! NOW!" One of them shouts in fear, running away. The others instantly follow suite, horrified that their massive group was quickly dealt with.

"N-nope! Nope! Not dealing with *that*!" Another one runs away.

"Please spare me, please spare me, please spare me!!!" And another. *Is she crying?*

"I knew I shouldn't have been a part of this!" ...and the last one.

With the delinquents scattering away, once again, silence.

...

"Uhhh... do we keep going?" Kai asks.

"...yeah." Shiro answers after a short delay. Meanwhile, the four girls are completely stunned.

"You four doing okay?" Emiya asks the girls.

"...don't you dare forget about the explanation." Yuuka answers.

"...noted." He concludes.

"That was... something."

Recovering from the stunlock, we begin the last trek to the tower.

---

///// POV: Shiro ///// <> ///// 150M to Sanctum Tower ////

"Almost there! The entrance is visible from here!" I say.

"Yes! Finally! I've had enough running for one day!" Yuuka shouts angrily, tired from all the running.

After a bit, we stop and hide, noticing the amasse of delinquents there.

"Lay low for now and take a short break. We'll be retaliating in a minute." Emiya commands, to which the others more than gladly follow, hiding behind debris and destroyed vehicles.

"Wait... Nano-sensei, couldn't you just send those... rocket orbs towards them?" Yuuka inquires.

"He could, but we aren't betting on him passing out from overusing his magic." Kai answers for Nano.

"Oh..." Yuuka trails off, realizing that's a possibility.

Fair assumption. Sure, it was found out that Nano's magic capacity is far higher than literally every single magic user back on Earth, but having him collapse from overusing it, WHILE in the middle of a literal gunfight, is probably the worst chain of events that could happen. **Especially** if the enemy isn't aware that we aren't bullet resistant like the other students.

So far, Nano has used 4 skills: The Targeted Repair skill for Yuuka's barrier, then 4 Rocket Orbs, one on a small group, and three on a large group, then the Front Barrier to protect himself against the large group while setting targets for those three orbs, and lastly, the Perception Boost skill to decrease the time he needed to assess the aformentioned targets.

And within that timespan, he hasn't been struck by any sudden fatigue, which is what magic users experience when overusing their skills.

"Alright, checking the area..." Niko enters line of sight slowly, assessing the stuff the enemies have. "A *bunch'a* delinquents, as usual. Though, this time it looks like they have a tank... and I also see someone on top of it." He shortly reports.

"A tank... must be the Crusader Tank that Momoka girl mentioned earlier." Emiya assumes.

"Can you see whose the one standing above it from here?" I ask Niko.

"Not much, though... oh dear, fox ears, tail, and a mask." He points out.

"Oh no. Hasumi, could you go confirm that?" Kai asks Hasumi.

"Affirmative." She enters line of sight, and squints her eyes a bit. "...target confirmed. The one above the tank is, indeed, the Fox of Calamity." She follows up, hiding again.

"**Scheiße**... looks like we'll have to deal with her after all." Kai says, swearing in German for some reason. Chinatsu narrows her eyes upon hearing that.

"*...does she understand German?*"

"Wouldn't a 'Rocket Orb' work on her?" Kai asks.

"It could, but she is very resilient to explosions, and her reaction time is unmatched, meaning she can very likely see and dodge the orb with exceptional speed." Hasumi answers.

"Ugh, now that just sucks... guess it's the gun-down route again." Kai groans. "How's everyone's ammo doing?" He asks the others.

"Well... enough to deal with the troublemakers, but way too little to deal with Wakamo." Yuuka responds.

"Since I only provide support... my supply is still plentiful, but I doubt I can do much." Then, Chinatsu.

"...like Yuuka, just enough rounds to deal with the heavy ones." Then Hasumi.

"My ammo is good, but I only have about 15 flashbangs left..." Then Suzumi, responding a bit sadly.

"Hmm... alright then. Nano, think you can do three more Rocket Orbs?" I ask Nano. As usual, he nods in response. "Good. I have a plan."

"What is it?" Emiya asks.

"Alright, so, to start..."

---

///// POV: Nano ///// <> ///// 75M to Sanctum Tower /////

"Fufufu~ looks like the puppies of the General Student Council have come to stop me. How adorable~" Wakamo says, a hint of teasing and mockery in her voice.

*Ghh... scary...*

As the four girls catch her attention, I begin focusing on my staff once more.

<center><strong>[ 'ROCKET ORB' 3X ]</strong></center>

And, once again, three orbs leave its core. I slowly charge them with magic, waiting for the right time to strike.

*RATATATATATATAT*

*Gunshots... the fight has started!*

"Flashbangs going out!" Suzumi shouts, throwing *five* flashbangs at once.

*How did she pull all those pins at once?*

"Agh!"

"Wah!"

"MY EYES!"

The delinquents cry out after being flashed.

"Alright, Yuuka! Your turn!" Shiro shouts at Yuuka.

"Here goes nothing!" She pops up from her place, and starts gunning down the disoriented targets.

"Hasumi! Think you can strike the tank?" Emiya asks Hasumi.

"I can." She answers simply. Taking a deep breath, a dark aura suddenly starts manifesting around her.

"...what in-" Emiya tries responding in surprise, but is suddenly cut off by Hasumi firing a seemingly *supercharged* bullet, which hits the tank and inflicts significant damage to it.

"...huh. Well, color me impressed." Emiya says, surprised and impressed.

"Well, my job here is done. You can all take care of the rest~" Wakamo says, leaving the battlegrounds.

*She actually left the scene...* I think to myself, surprised when Shiro had predicted that Wakamo would actually leave after a bit.

*Alright, now's my time...*

<center><strong>[ 'FRONT BARRIER' ]</strong></center>

I begin speeding up the magic output to the orbs, and prepare another barrier to protect myself.

*Again, one...*

*Two...*

*And... THREE!*

The orbs turn red, and I enter into view, preparing my staff.

<center><strong>[ 'PERCEPTION BOOST' ]</strong></center>

Before the delinquents can even notice me, I immediately cast Perception Boost, slowing down time once more.

*So... two large groups and the tank.*

I assess the surrounding area. A bunch of delinquents, conscious and unconscious, and the tank, which is partially smoking.

*Alright, here... there, and... finally, the tank.*

I successfully assign targets for the rocket orbs to hit. Taking another deep breath...

*BZZZT*

*...huh?*

<center><strong>[ 'ROCKET ORB' HAS AWAKENED TO GAMMA! ]</strong></center>
<center><strong>[ EXPLOSION STRENGTH INCREASED! ]</strong></center>

Suddenly, I feel a strike of energy reach me. It also feels like I can dump even more power into the orbs...

*I don't know what's happening, but I might as well take advantage of this!*

I begin charging the orbs with even more magic, up until it's new limit.

*Alright, here goes...! Eat this, you block of metal!*

I raise my staff up, and-

*SWOOSH*

-slash it down, signaling the orbs to strike once again. Following how I did it the first time, I drop the perception boost.

"NO! NOT AGAI-"

*BOOOOOOOOOOOOM*

One of the surviving delinquents from the first strike is abruptly cut off as the orb strikes the area near her, exploding. The second orb also does the same.

As for the one targeted at the tank...

*BOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOM*

...it strikes, exploding like the others. The tank, already having sustained heavy damage from Hasumi's supercharged bullet, also explodes.

*Holy hell...*

And, for the third time: Radio silence.

"RETREAT!!!!!" One of the delinquents breaks the silence, running away in utter terror like the others.

"AAAAAAHHHHHHHHH!!!"

"NOPE! NOPE! NEVER AGAIN!"

"I REALLY REGRET BEING A PART OF THIS!!!"

...

.....

.......

"...job complete." Shiro breaks the silence. Again.

"The power behind those orbs is terrifying..." Chinatsu points out.

"Well, Chinatsu, you haven't seen everything yet..." Niko says.

---

///// POV: Shiro ///// <> //// Sanctum Tower - Front Entrance /////

I pull out the drone that Rin gave me and use the radio on it.

"Rin?" I speak into it.

"Shiro-sensei?" She responds back.

"We've reached the tower and cleared out the delinquents." I report.

"...!" I hear her make a slightly surprised noise. "I see... what about Wakamo?" She asks.

"She left the area mid-fight. We're not sure where she is." I answer.

"Hmm... well, for now, what matters is that the tower is now reclaimed. I'll be there in a moment." She says.

"Got it. Do me and the others head into the basement now?" I ask.

"If you can find your way there, please do." She answers.

"Alright, see you soon." I conclude.

"So, heading to the basement?" Niko asks.

"Yeah." I answer simply. "Yuuka, y'all wanna follow along?" I ask the four girls.

"No... I need a break..." She answers tiredly.

"...fair enough. Alright, guys, let's go." I signal the others to follow me.

And so, we make our way into the tower.
