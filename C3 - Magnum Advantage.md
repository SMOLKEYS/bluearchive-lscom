///// POV: Shiro /////

Bullets whizz around us as we make our way to the Sanctum Tower, with various delinquents and thugs (as the group called them) blocking our way, stopping us from getting there. Hasumi, Chinatsu me and the other 4 stay behind, while Suzumi and Yuuka take the frontlines.

So far, our current formation is working relatively well; Hasumi and Chinatsu stay behind to provide heavy-hitting firepower and healing support if needed, while Suzumi stays somewhat close to us to provide extra firepower and disorient the enemies with her flashbangs, which then gives Yuuka the opportunity to gun them down with her dual-wield SMGs, which are apparently named "Logic" and "Reason".

...I feel like I now know why she had an extreme reaction towards magic compared to the others. As far as I'm concerned, science and magic do *not* mix well, or at all.

As for me and the other 4, we're all currently laying low since we have no haloes, which apparently just turns these girls into literal superhumans, boosting their strength significantly and giving them *bullet resistance*, which lets them tank and shrug off most bullets. *So that's why guns just existed everywhere...*

*Haloes. A common element that ALL Kivotos students have.*

*As we made our way to the Sanctum Tower, Rin, Yuuka and Chinatsu gave us information on what they're for. Apparently, as far as they're concerned, it has existed for as long as they can remember.*

*They provide students with immense physical power and bullet resistance, which lets them tank bullets of all kinds and even explosives, though they still can get injured. Some students can also develop their halo further, giving them more strength or amplifying their current abilities.*

*And after some extra explanations from Chinatsu, I concluded that haloes have three different states:*

*First: Active, which basically indicates that a student is currently awake. Their halo is fully visible, and can be used to see if they're faking being asleep or unconscious.*

*Second: Inactive, which is when a student is actually unconscious, whether from sleeping or tanking too much damage in a firefight. At this state, their halo isn't visible.*

*And lastly, an incredibly rare and dark one: Shattered. This is considered a dark one, since this indicates that a student has been effectively KILLED, leaving behind fragments of the destroyed halo that eventually disappears, and the body of the dead student.*

*Apparently, deaths are incredibly rare in Kivotos, whether that'd be among the students, animal-people or automatons. But, there have been some reported cases. These only occur when a student sustains way too much damage that even their halo can't keep up with, or through something so strong it can bypass the protection the halo gives, leaving them fatally injured.*

*There is nothing about the third state that I like. For god's sake, they're NOT even adults yet! They still have their youthful lives that they haven't fully experienced yet! And even if they were already adults, an early death is NOT something they should have!*

*...*

*...oh, god damn it, going off-track again...*

*Anyways, basically: Student or not, death is NOT something they deserve. Not NOW, not TODAY, not EVER. End of story.*

"Yuuka! You doing okay over there?!" I shout towards her direction.

"So far so good! My barrier's holding up for a lot longer than usual, which is helping!" She shouts back, tanking enemy fire with her calculator barrier, aptly called "Q.E.D", which Nano is secretly repairing.

"...hmm, is your magic control fine, Nano?" Emiya asks Nano, to which he nods in response. "I see..."

For now, we haven't tried out using Nano's magic for attacking, and have only been using it to constantly repair Yuuka's barrier. We aren't taking any chances on its stability for offensive attacks, or for the safety of the enemies. At the end of the day, they're still students like Yuuka, Hasumi, Chinatsu, Suzumi... and perhaps even Rin.

...this world is strange.
