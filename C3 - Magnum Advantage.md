///// POV: Shiro ///// <> ///// 29.7KM to Sanctum Tower /////

Bullets whizz all around us as we make our way to the Sanctum Tower, with various delinquents and sukebans (as the group called them) blocking our way, stopping us from getting there. Hasumi, Chinatsu me and the other 4 stay behind, while Suzumi and Yuuka take the frontlines.

So far, our current formation is working relatively well; Hasumi and Chinatsu stay behind to provide heavy-hitting firepower and healing support if needed, while Suzumi stays somewhat close to us to provide extra firepower and disorient the enemies with her flashbangs, which then gives Yuuka the opportunity to gun them down with her dual-wield SMGs, which are apparently named "Logic" and "Reason".

...I feel like I now know why she had an extreme reaction towards magic compared to the others. As far as I'm concerned, science and magic do *not* mix well, or at all.

As for me and the other 4, we're all currently laying low since we have no haloes, which apparently just turns these girls into literal superhumans, boosting their strength significantly and giving them *bullet resistance*, which lets them tank and shrug off most bullets. *So that's why guns just existed everywhere...*

---

*Haloes. A common element that ALL Kivotos students have.*

*As we made our way to the Sanctum Tower, Rin, Yuuka and Chinatsu gave us information on what they're for. Apparently, as far as they're concerned, it has existed for as long as they can remember.*

*They provide students with immense physical power and bullet resistance, which lets them tank bullets of all kinds and even explosives, though they still can get injured. Some students can also develop their halo further, giving them more strength or amplifying their current abilities.*

*And after some extra explanations from Chinatsu, I concluded that haloes have three different states:*

*First: Active, which basically indicates that a student is currently awake. Their halo is fully visible, and can be used to see if they're faking being asleep or unconscious.*

*Second: Inactive, which is when a student is actually unconscious, whether from sleeping or tanking too much damage in a firefight. At this state, their halo isn't visible.*

*And lastly, an incredibly rare and dark one: Shattered. This is considered a dark one, since this indicates that a student has been effectively KILLED, leaving behind fragments of the destroyed halo that eventually disappears, and the body of the dead student.*

*Apparently, deaths are incredibly rare in Kivotos, whether that'd be among the students, animal-people or automatons. But, there have been some reported cases. These only occur when a student sustains way too much damage that even their halo can't keep up with, or through something so strong it can bypass the protection the halo gives, leaving them fatally injured.*

*There is nothing about the third state that I like. For god's sake, they're NOT even adults yet! They still have their youthful lives that they haven't fully experienced yet! And even if they were already adults, an early death is NOT something they should have!*

*...*

*...oh, god damn it, going off-track again...*

*Anyways, basically: Student or not, death is NOT something they deserve. Not NOW, not TODAY, not EVER. End of story.*

"Yuuka! You doing okay over there?!" I shout towards her direction.

"So far so good! My barrier's holding up for a lot longer than usual thanks to Nano, which is helping!" She shouts back, tanking enemy fire with her calculator barrier, aptly called "Q.E.D", which Nano is repairing.

"...hmm, is your magic control fine, Nano?" Emiya asks Nano, to which he nods in response. "I see..."

For now, we haven't tried out using Nano's magic for attacking, and have only been using it to constantly repair Yuuka's barrier. We aren't taking any chances on its stability for offensive attacks, or for the safety of the enemies. At the end of the day, they're still students like Yuuka, Hasumi, Chinatsu, Suzumi... and perhaps even Rin.

...this world is strange.

"Enemy with an RPG hiding behind that smoking vehicle!" I point out to Hasumi.

"Got it." She nods in response. Reloading her weapon, she then fires a bullet charged with some sort of energy, striking the delinquent square on the head, knocking them out immediately.

"*Hmm... are their haloes improving and strengthening their capabilities?*" I think to myself. "*Also, to hit a clean shot to the forehead at such a distance...*"

"Hm. Impressive aim." I say somewhat offhandedly, realizing she managed to strike a headshot on a target a fair distance away with a scopeless rifle.

"This is nothing compared to my typical work in Trinity, but regardless... thank you for the compliment." She responds back, her cheeks slightly dusted pink.

///// POV: Helmeted Delinquent A ///// <> ///// 17.5KM to Sanctum Tower /////

"*Damn it! How are they tearing down our forces so easily?! It's literally HUNDREDS to FOUR! HOW?!*"

"*Also, why won't that damned Millennium student's shield break?! We've been gunning it down for so long now! It even tanked THREE damn RPG rounds! Surely that would have been enough to break most shields, right?!*"

As I continue shooting at the four opposing forces destroying our group, I notice something floating besides that huge Trinity student with a rifle. It looks like... a blue orb?

"*...okay, now what the hell is that supposed to be now?*"

"*...huh, it turned red? Wait, it's getting bigger, too.*"

...wait, no.

"*HUH?! IT"S HEADING STRAIGHT FOR ME-*"

***BOOOOOOOOM***

I get violently interrupted as it explodes in front of my face, launching me and the others back.

"..."

"...what... the fuck... was *that*....?"

---

///// POV: Shiro /////

"Ah..." I trail off, staring at the aftermath of Nano's orb explosion. "That... worked out."

"This silence... is fucking painful." Kai mutters, noticing that everyone has just completely stopped fighting after the orb exploded.

Nano just stands where he is, and like the others at the moment, eyes wide and mouth agape.

*...I don't think he, or literally everyone else, was expecting that.*

"...hm, I think 'Rocket Orb' was too much." Emiya realizes.

"...how do you even know that exists?" Niko asks Emiya.

"I found out about it while talking to a magic-explosives expert back on Earth." He answers.

"Alright..." Niko trails off.

Meanwhile, Nano shifts his attention to us, a desperate "*Wil she be okay???*" on his face.

"Yeah, she'll probably be fine... probably." I answer, unsure myself. "Anyways..."

///// POV: Shiro ///// <> ///// 4.4KM to Sanctum Tower /////

"Area clear!" I shout out.

"The Sanctum Tower is close by. Just an estimated... four more kilometers until we reach it." Hasumi points out.

With the tower close, me and the other 4 take a look at it.

"Woah..." I look in awe. Amongst all the buildings, the Sanctum Tower stands as the tallest one. There looks to also be some sort of pillar at the top, which is somehow extending *even* higher up, reaching the sky haloes. Actually, hold on, it looks like the haloes come *from* the tower itself.

*Rin did mention that the president was the top administrator for this tower... yeah, that checks out.*

*...it hasn't even been a day since we arrived, and somehow I'm already getting used to whatever mysteries this president left behind.*
