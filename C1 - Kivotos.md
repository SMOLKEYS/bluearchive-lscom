...

...

I wake up on a train seat, my eyes momentarily blinded by the light outside. It's moving, but it's also oddly silent.

What catches my attention though, is just ahead of me.

---

At the seat ahead of me sits an injured girl, her sky blue hair flowing down, and her body clad in a formerly pristine uniform, now stained by blood. For some reason, I can't seem to see her face at all.

After another look, I notice something else on top of her head.

A... halo? It looks simple, a ring and a star, slightly offset to the right.

...

I don't know why, but she seems so familiar...

Have we crossed paths before?

---

**...it was all my fault.**

*What do you mean?*

I try and speak my thoughts, but I quickly notice... I can't move, nor speak. I still have my tactile senses, as I notice something, or *someone*, besides me, most likely unable to move too.

I guess I won't be alone.

**My decisions, and everything they caused.**

*...don't blame yourself. It was beyond your control.*

Suddenly, a flashback of a memory reaches me.

---

...

The skies are grey.

The rain is depressing.

**The world has fallen.**

**Everyone is gone.**

And the lone wolf student looks at me with immense regret, her weapon aimed at my dying body.

---

The memory breaks into static for a moment, and restores itself, several minutes passing within.

---

*The sky begins to crack.*

***And the lone student could only look in utter horror, as she is fully aware of the one behind the impending disaster.***

*For a moment, everything goes silent...*

...

<center><h3>AND THEN, IT SHATTERS.</h3></center>

<center><h2>REVEALING THE TRUE VOID BEYOND</h2></center>

<center><h1>AND ITS LONE OCCUPANT WITHIN.</h1></center>

---

The memory falls back to static once more, sending me back to the train.

---

**It had to come to this for me to finally realize that you were right all along.**

**So forgive me for being so bold, but I must ask for your help.**

***...Shiro-sensei.***

As she calls my name, various memories begin to come back to me.

Memories... of various schools, and their students.

Again, I've never met any of them, but... why? Why are they so... familiar?

At the same time, she then-

***Niko-sensei.***

***Kai-sensei.***

***Emiya-sensei.***

***...and Nano-sensei.***

-mentions the others with me, which most likely also reawakened various memories they had.

**After this, you'll forget these words, but it won't matter.**

*...*

**Even without your memories, you'll probably make the same decision in the same situation...**

*Well, if you know who I am... then you aren't wrong.*

**Therefore, I believe what matters most are the choices we make, not the experiences we have.**

*And that is so. Every choice that you make, big or small, can have a proportionally similar impact to your life, and possibly those around you.*

**There are choices only you can make.**

Another influx of memories awaken deep in my mind. Again, the familiarity is still there...

**I've spoken of responsibility before.**

**I didn't truly understand it then, but now I do.**

**Adulthood, responsibility, obligation... and the choices you make that extend beyond those ideals.**

**I even understand their implications.**

*Well... I suppose that comes with growing up and becoming an adult.*

**Therefore, Shiro-sensei, and everyone else...**

...

**...you're the only ones I can trust.**

**Only you all can free us from this twisted, distorted fate...**

...!

**...and find the choices that will lead us to a new reality.**

**So, Sensei. Please...**

...

...

...

---

At that moment, Shiro, Niko, Kai, Emiya and Nano had made a shared decision.

*...I'll do my best, for yours and everyone else's sake.* Shiro answered.

*Well, Prez, you have my full support, and everyone else's.* Niko answered.

*Heh heh... memories or not, you already know my answer.* Kai answered.

*As usual of who I am, I'll make sure this new reality comes to be.* Emiya answered.

Writing noises could be heard from Nano's place. He was able to move his arms and hands, and used it to write his answer down on a notebook. He then raised it towards the girl-

<center><i>I'll help, as much as I can.</i></center>

-and showed his answer.

**...thank you. All of you.**

As the injured president girl gave her thanks, the five Senseis slowly drifted back to unconsciousness once more. Destined to forget the encounter, but armed with a sense of familiarity.

And so, onward, to their next destination: **Kivotos.**

---

///// POV: Shiro /////

...

*...ugh...*

*That train ride... felt weird.*

*Wait, what am I sleeping on? This doesn't feel like the train.*

As I try and recall what happened during the trip, I notice that everything seems oddly silent, and I'm sleeping on something soft. I open my eyes, the first thing entering my vision being a white ceiling. Am I not on the train anymore?

"Huh...?"

As I raise myself up to a seating position, I realize that an entire section of my memory seems to be oddly... blank. The only thing I remember is the first few minutes of the trip, and then, nothing in between. Wh-

"Ugh... where the fuck...?" Before I could continue my thoughts, Kai groans himself awake, his vocabulary unfiltered as usual. He raises his upper body to a seating position.

Actually, where's the other three?

"Mornin', sleepyheads." My question is answered as Niko's voice calls out to us. I face myself towards him, and notice he's looking out of a window. Emiya and Nano are also awake, standing besides him.

"Where are we? And why am I just on the floor?" Kai asked.

"We're currently in our destination, Kivotos, from what we've seen so far." Emiya answered. 'Oh, Niko also insisted on letting you two wake up on your own, and to leave you on the ground." He then followed up.

"Niko, you goddamn... ugh, nevermind. Damn it, my neck's stiff now." Kai tried to argue, but felt too tired to deal with Niko, choosing to massage his neck instead.

"Also, how did we end up here? I'm pretty sure we were all on a train when we fell asleep." I ask.

"Well... we don't know, actually. I woke up first, and everyone else was already here." Niko answered, unsure.

"*Huh... who brought us here?*"

"Actually, guys, hold on. Do you guys remember anything in between us falling asleep on the train and waking up here?" I ask, oddly curious.

"What do you mean? We went on the train, and then... we... actually, why does it feel like something's missing?" Kai trails off, realizing a part of his memory is abruptly missing.

"So it wasn't just us, then... Apparently, Emiya never even woke up once during the entire trip, which seems impossible since he always wakes up once in a while to check on the surroundings. Well, it's either that, or our memories got completely wiped out." Niko added.

"Huh. That letter we received was already suspicious on its own, and now part of our memories somehow gets wiped clean off our brains..." Kai trailed off, remembering the time we received the letter.

Well, I can agree on that. As far as we know, Kivotos is a community found in Greece, and it certainly didn't have places this... clean and oddly futuristic.

...wait a second. I'm pretty sure Kivotos is a Greek word that translates to "ark" in English. Could that mean anything?

"Wait, what's this?" Kai asks, noticing and picking up a letter on the ground. It's sealed with a red circle sticker on the middle.

"From: Prez
To: Rin-chan." He reads the text on the letter itself, which refers to someone called "Prez" and "Rin-chan". 

Something about this letter gives off a high sense of significance...

Prez seems to be short for President, and "Rin-chan"... her friend, perhaps?

We pause for a moment to think.

"Looks that might be the case." Our thoughts are interrupted by Niko agreeing with Nano, who wrote something in his notebook.

"Oh, anything in mind, Nano?" Kai asks him. He nods and faces his notebook to us.

<center><i>Should we go meet this "Rin-chan"?</i></center>

...

"Well... can't really think of anything else, so looks like that'll be the case." Kai responds to Nano's question.

"Now then... shall we go?" Emiya asks.

"Alright. Stay alert, since this place looks unfamiliar." I answer.

We prepare ourselves and head out, bringing the letter along.

...

"...uh, where the hell do we find her?"

...good question, Kai.

---

///// POV: Niko /////

Well, based off what I've been seeing, Kivotos... is certainly breathtaking.

Everything looks well maintained, the streets are bustling with people....

Though, what caught our eyes are-

---

"I'm not going insane, am I?" Kai asks, baffled.

"Nope, we're seeing exactly what you're seeing." Shiro answers, equally baffled.

Meanwhile, I'm just absolutely intrigued. Same goes for Emiya and Nano.

The streets and various other places we've seen are filled with various talking bipedal animals (notably cats and dogs), seemingly sentient robot humanoids manning the various shops, and... schoolgirls.

Schoolgirls with haloes.

And guns.

Yes, you heard me right.

***GUNS.***

All of them have various different ones, ranging from small weapons like pistols, to SMGs and LMGs, to shotguns, then to *actual sniper rifles.* I also swear on my life that I saw one carrying a goddamn gatling gun.

Oh, and I can't forget to mention the haloes on the literal sky, which seems to stem from something on the center.

And the blimp in the sky. That *also* has a halo.

...

Initially, we thought that the guns were fake. Maybe just some sort of weird trend in this place, who knows?

Then, immediately after that thought, we end up hearing gunshots. In every direction. No one proceeded to pay any mind to it.

So, yep, these guns are as real as they can get.

...

"*Pardon my language, but, just...*"

"*...what the fuck?*"

---

"...well, I guess we won't be getting anywhere just standing here. Let's keep moving." Emiya breaks us out of our trances.

"Alright then."

The intrigue towards Kivotos now settled, it's time to look for this "Rin-chan".

...easier said than done.

---

///// POV: Shiro /////

After asking around for a bit, we were told that this Rin person, her full name being Nanagami Rin, could be found in this "GSC" building, which we now have directions to.

Based on the posters and signs we've been seeing, the GSC is short for "General Student Council", with this Rin girl being the vice-president for it. Is it Kivotos' central governing body?

The news, for this world at least, seems to mention the GSC President is possibly missing.

...did she really just leave us a letter to bring to her friend and completely disappear from the face of the city she governs over?

Also, is it just me or-

"Uh, guys, have any of you noticed that there seems to be no, well, *human male* in sight, other than us?" My thought process is broken by Kai asking something, noticing the composition of the population.

Nano nods as an answer.

As we made our way around, all of us did eventually notice that there wasn't any male student, or human male for that matter, *anywhere*, save me and the other 4. Everyone that wasn't an animal or robot, A.K.A, the students, were ALL girls.

Do they just... not exist here?

Hold on, is that the reason why we've been receiving looks and stares from *literally everywhere*? Animal, robot and student alike, they were all looking at us in curiosity, some talking with each other.

---

"Who are those people?"

"Don't ask me! I'm as clueless as you are!"

"Wait, look, they don't have a halo!"

"Huh? Oh!"

---

"...damn, not even down to a whisper." Kai mumbles to himself.

"I mean, they haven't been saying anything negative, so that's good." I reply.

"Also, they're pointing out the fact that we don't have haloes, so that means being haloless here seems to be rare." Niko mentions.

Eventually, after walking around for a while, we arrived at the GSC building. It looks really clean and modern, same goes for everything else around it.

"So, assuming the directions we received were correct, this should be the place." Emiya points out, gesturing at the entrance.

"Well, that should be the case, so... let's head in?" Kai asks.

"Alright, here goes..."

---

To Nanagami Rin, this day wasn't a good day. Hell, the entire week in general wasn't good. At all.

Because just right before the despicable week occurred, her friend, the General Student Council President, had just disappeared entirely. No fanfare, no warning, just, gone and done.

Any and every attempt on finding her never bore fruit, and at the same time, Kivotos slowly descended to chaotic anarchy.

Smoke began to bellow from random places, gunfights began to intensify progressively, and all schools, major and minor, began to suffer major issues, no thanks to the GSC losing access to the Sanctum Tower, basically making them almost powerless to do anything, and taking down systems from various schools with it.

The only 2 things she could hold onto now was somehow regaining access to the Sanctum Tower, and... the five supposed visitors to arrive.

Before the President's disappearance, she had mentioned something to Rin: 5 people would arrive at the GSC building.

The most notable details is that they would be *human males*, which is basically uncalled for in Kivotos, and that they would be haloless.

However, she had also added that they have their "ways" to get around despite their weakness. Rin tried asking for further elaboration, but-

"Don't worry, dear Rin-chan, you'll eventually find out~"

-that was the best she got from her friend. Always so eccentric and mysterious...

...

As every second passed, her hopes slowly started to fade. Sanctum Tower reclamation failed over and over, and the supposed visitors weren't anywhere in sight. At this rate, Kivotos would genuinely crumble and fall. All while she and the GSC couldn't do anything to stop it.

However, this day, despite being painful at just the morning, had something in stock for her.

**It wasn't all dark just yet.**

---

///// POV: Rin /////

*Just... where? Where did you go?* I thought to myself, thinking about her. Frustration kept building up within me as Kivotos slowly degraded to anarchy.

*We still can't regain access to the Sanctum Tower, and those 'visitors' are nowhere to be seen.*

As my thoughts run rampant, eventually, despair began building up too.

This week has been horrible.

Just.

**Absolutely.**

***HORRIBLE!***

There was panic basically everywhere, complaints and requests for help began accumulating extremely fast, and as if those weren't bad enough, the Seven Prisoners had successfully broken out of the Corrections Bureau amidst everything, some of them bringing forth more chaos.

...

The despair build-up began to intensify.

"*Is this really... how it ends for Kivotos?*"

"*Us being near powerless, while everything breaks down?*"

"*...just, what were you thinking-*"

*ring ring*

Before I could spiral down in despair, the phone to the ground floor, where Ayumu was, started ringing. I... hesitated for a moment.

At the back of my mind, I could only hope that it would be *them*.

...

In the blink of an eye, I grabbed the phone, and answered.

"A-Acting President Rin! T-there's five haloless people here a-and a letter from the President!" Ayumu's panicked voice blared out of the speakers.

...

.....

.......

---

Rin froze for a moment.

This was it. *They* were here. The ones who could supposedly save Kivotos from total anarchy.

Alongside that, was also a letter from none other than her friend.

...

And so, Rin brought her request.

<center>"...bring them here."</center>

---

///// POV: Kai /////

"So, uh, if you don't mind us asking, what's your name?" I ask the timid blonde girl as we travel up the elevator.

"O-oh, my apologies. My name is Iwabitsu Ayumu, secretary of the Acting President. I-it's nice to meet you all." She introduces herself, small stutters here and there.

"Well, nice to meet ya, Ayumu." I reply back.

"N-nice to meet you too... um..." She trails off. Oh right, we also haven't introduced ourselves.

"Kai. Enami Kai." I start.

"Tendou Shiro. Nice to meet you." Shiro follows up.

"Tendou Niko. Similar sentiment. Oh, and yes, me and Shiro are siblings." And then Niko.

"Hatora Emiya, you may call me Emiya for short." Then Emiya, and then...

Nano starts writing something on his notebook, then faces it towards Ayumu's direction.

<center><i>Kantami Nano.</i></center>

<center><i>Nice to meet you too, Miss Ayumu.</i></center>

<center><i>I can't exactly speak. I'm sorry.</i></center>

Ayumu starts reading the text, and her eyes widen a bit.

"A-ah, please don't apologize, i-it's okay!" She responds, slightly panicked.

Nano responds back with a small nod and a smile.

"Well, introductions aside, this elevator leads us to Rin?" Niko asks.

"Ah, yes. We will be there in a moment." Ayumu answers.

"*Hmm, alright then.*"

After a short wait, we eventually reach the elevator's destination.

As we walk out of the elevator, we're met with a really sleek and clean office lounge. They really work all out to keep this place, or possibly this *entire damn city*, clean, huh?

"Oh, wow, as clean as everywhere else, huh?" Shiro rhetorically asks while impressed.

"U-uhm, may I ask all of you to wait here for a moment?" Ayumu asks us.

"Yes, it's okay." Emiya answers.

"T-thank you." She thanks us as she walks into what probably is the main office for this Rin girl.

...

Hmm...

---

For a moment, the five shared a common thought.

<center>"<i>We'll be in this city for a LONG while, huh?</i>"</center>
