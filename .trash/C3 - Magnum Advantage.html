<p>///// POV: Shiro /////</p>
<p>Bullets whizz around us as we make our way to the Sanctum Tower, with
various delinquents and thugs (as the group called them) blocking our
way, stopping us from getting there. Hasumi, Chinatsu me and the other 4
stay behind, while Suzumi and Yuuka take the frontlines.</p>
<p>So far, our current formation is working relatively well; Hasumi and
Chinatsu stay behind to provide heavy-hitting firepower and healing
support if needed, while Suzumi stays somewhat close to us to provide
extra firepower and disorient the enemies with her flashbangs, which
then gives Yuuka the opportunity to gun them down with her dual-wield
SMGs, which are apparently named “Logic” and “Reason”.</p>
<p>…I feel like I now know why she had an extreme reaction towards magic
compared to the others. As far as I’m concerned, science and magic do
<em>not</em> mix well, or at all.</p>
<p>As for me and the other 4, we’re all currently laying low since we
have no haloes, which apparently just turns these girls into literal
superhumans, boosting their strength significantly and giving them
<em>bullet resistance</em>, which lets them tank and shrug off most
bullets. <em>So that’s why guns just existed everywhere…</em></p>
<hr />
<p><em>Haloes. A common element that ALL Kivotos students have.</em></p>
<p><em>As we made our way to the Sanctum Tower, Rin, Yuuka and Chinatsu
gave us information on what they’re for. Apparently, as far as they’re
concerned, it has existed for as long as they can remember.</em></p>
<p><em>They provide students with immense physical power and bullet
resistance, which lets them tank bullets of all kinds and even
explosives, though they still can get injured. Some students can also
develop their halo further, giving them more strength or amplifying
their current abilities.</em></p>
<p><em>And after some extra explanations from Chinatsu, I concluded that
haloes have three different states:</em></p>
<p><em>First: Active, which basically indicates that a student is
currently awake. Their halo is fully visible, and can be used to see if
they’re faking being asleep or unconscious.</em></p>
<p><em>Second: Inactive, which is when a student is actually
unconscious, whether from sleeping or tanking too much damage in a
firefight. At this state, their halo isn’t visible.</em></p>
<p><em>And lastly, an incredibly rare and dark one: Shattered. This is
considered a dark one, since this indicates that a student has been
effectively KILLED, leaving behind fragments of the destroyed halo that
eventually disappears, and the body of the dead student.</em></p>
<p><em>Apparently, deaths are incredibly rare in Kivotos, whether that’d
be among the students, animal-people or automatons. But, there have been
some reported cases. These only occur when a student sustains way too
much damage that even their halo can’t keep up with, or through
something so strong it can bypass the protection the halo gives, leaving
them fatally injured.</em></p>
<p><em>There is nothing about the third state that I like. For god’s
sake, they’re NOT even adults yet! They still have their youthful lives
that they haven’t fully experienced yet! And even if they were already
adults, an early death is NOT something they should have!</em></p>
<p><em>…</em></p>
<p><em>…oh, god damn it, going off-track again…</em></p>
<p><em>Anyways, basically: Student or not, death is NOT something they
deserve. Not NOW, not TODAY, not EVER. End of story.</em></p>
<hr />
<p>“Yuuka! You doing okay over there?!” I shout towards her
direction.</p>
<p>“So far so good! My barrier’s holding up for a lot longer than usual,
which is helping!” She shouts back, tanking enemy fire with her
calculator barrier, aptly called “Q.E.D”, which Nano is secretly
repairing.</p>

<p>“…hmm, is your magic control fine, Nano?” Emiya asks Nano, to which
he nods in response. “I see…”</p>
<p>For now, we haven’t tried out using Nano’s magic for attacking, and
have only been using it to constantly repair Yuuka’s barrier. We aren’t
taking any chances on its stability for offensive attacks, or for the
safety of the enemies. At the end of the day, they’re still students
like Yuuka, Hasumi, Chinatsu, Suzumi… and perhaps even Rin.</p>
<p>Though, so far</p>
