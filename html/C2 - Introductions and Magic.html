</header>
<p>///// POV: Shiro /////</p>
<p>As we wait for Ayumu and Rin, I couldn’t help but wander around in my
thoughts for a while.</p>
<hr />
<p><em>Hmm…</em></p>
<p><em>If that president girl was the one who brought us here… how? And
why?</em></p>
<p><em>Everything in this city was odd. Bipedal animals, truly sentient
robots, and most of all, armed schoolgirls with haloes.</em></p>
<p><em>A place like this doesn’t exist on Earth, so… an alternate
universe, perhaps?</em></p>
<p><em>…</em></p>
<p><em>Why am I not surprised?</em></p>
<p><em>…</em></p>
<p><em>Heh, probably has something to do with the weird stuff we’ve seen
or have been involved in.</em></p>
<hr />
<p><em>First, our own home, Earth.</em></p>
<p><em>We already knew long ago about the various… “quirks” that some
people had, but to actually see them in person and even be a part of it
is an entire experience on its own.</em></p>
<p><em>Second, our nomadic lifestyle.</em></p>
<p><em>For 5 years, we’ve traveled across the entire globe. We would
constantly move around, rest in hotels, or camp if we were outdoors. In
that time, we would also gather souvenirs, make various friends, good
associates and even learn some languages. It was pretty good,
honestly.</em></p>
<p><em>And lastly, magic. ACTUAL. MAGIC.</em></p>
<p><em>A few years back, news and headlines appeared of some people
suddenly being able to manipulate and control elements and bring up
actual magic circles. At first, people were split in between deep
intrigue in how it works, and people who were outright calling it fake,
saying it was just CGI and referring to science, notably the laws of
physics and thermodynamics.</em></p>
<p><em>Though, their worldview and those said laws would end up being
utterly shattered within the span of a month as magic appeared
EVERYWHERE, all over the globe with various people being blessed with
it. Scientists tried their absolute damnedest to make it make logical
sense, but failed. Meanwhile, the ones originally calling it fake were
split in two categories:</em></p>
<p><em>The ones who finally believed it, and the ones who became even
more… delusional, for a lack of a better term that I know of. Various
conspiracy theories like the waters being drugged by the government to
give the illusion of magic, or some sort of invisible drones being used
to manipulate elements like fire, or projectors for the magic circles,
et cetera.</em></p>
<p><em>Some people will never fail to amaze me and the others for the
lengths they will go to just to deny something.</em></p>
<p><em>As for us? Well, we didn’t have much to say, other than the
thought of “well, this was inevitable”. It wasn’t a matter of IF it
would happen, but WHEN. Meanwhile, surprisingly, the government hadn’t
tried doing anything yet. They acknowledged it, but didn’t try doing
anything to the people who had it. Whether or not that’s out of fear or
patience, I’ll never know.</em></p>
<p><em>For a few months, it’s just been business as usual. We eat,
sleep, travel, sleep, eat, so on and so forth. Though, our routines did
give us a chance to actually meet with the magic-bearers.</em></p>
<p><em>It was certainly interesting and honestly pretty damn cool, to
say the least.</em></p>
<p><em>Eventually though, after a year, the ‘blessings’ stopped, leaving
an estimated total of 15 million people with magical capabilities.
During that timespan, new artifacts began to appear around the world,
which could boost people’s magical capabilities, allow them to utilize
new kinds of magic, or even give people who didn’t receive magical
capabilities to actually use it. Meanwhile, existing ones also received
magical power held in them.</em></p>
<p><em>Though, it wasn’t all positives. Some artifacts would actually
end up cursing people instead, with one of the worst cases being the
Death Touch case, where a person in Europe could kill anything that he
physically touched, except himself. Plant, animal, human, it didn’t
matter. Plants would wilt and rot immediately, while animals and humans
would have their hearts and brain activity INSTANTLY stop, collapsing
and ending their life then and there.</em></p>
<p><em>Unfortunately, he didn’t last very long, as he would be found
dead by suicide just a week after receiving the curse. Poor
guy.</em></p>
<p><em>Though, anyways. Other than the dark cases, everything was, as I
said, business as usual. Well, up until the last day of the magic
drops.</em></p>
<p><em>Imagine our surprise when Nano ended up being one of the last 100
people to receive magical capabilities. Now imagine our surprise again
when it was found out that his capabilities were amplified far, FAR
higher than anyone else’s.</em></p>
<p><em>…</em></p>
<p><em>…oh wait, I went FAR off track there, did I?</em></p>
<p><em>Well, to make a long story short: Shit has happened in our world,
notably magic, and it made us desensitized to most surprising
things.</em></p>
<p><em>Honestly, am I just in a long-ass dream, or…</em></p>
<hr />
<p>I pinch my cheek. Niko notices me doing that.</p>
<p>“Nope. Not a dream, Shiro.” He points out.</p>
<p>“How’d you-”</p>
<p>“I know you do that whenever we end up stumbling on something utterly
stupid or absurd.”</p>
<p>“…fair enough.”</p>
<p>As I settle my long thought process, Ayumu appears from the office
doors, probably done talking with Rin.</p>
<p>“Uhm, you may all come in now.” Ayumu signals us to come into the
office.</p>
<p>“Alright, let’s go.”</p>
<p>We stand up from the seats we’re in, and walk towards the office
doors, which Ayumu is holding open.</p>
<hr />
<p>///// POV: Niko /////</p>
<p>As we step into the office, we’re met with the usual cleanliness
we’ve seen almost everywhere. This time, however, there’s a girl on the
main office table, probably waiting for us. Perhaps this is that “Rin”
girl?</p>
<p>Her details are… quite elegant, to say the least. Long, straight jet
black hair that almost touches the ground, with dark blue colors on the
inner side that gets more saturated as it reaches the bottom, and
similarly black bangs on her forehead. Alongside that is their probable
standard uniform with gold buttons, and accents. Along her waist is a
white belt with golden buckles, holding a pistol hoister.</p>
<p>Though, the most noticeable details are her elf ears and halo, which
has a bluish gradient and resembles a crown of sorts.</p>
<p>She certainly gives off an aura of elegance and authoritativeness.
Though, at the same time, she seems to be noticeably tired.</p>
<p>Such is the ways of being in a high position, I suppose.</p>
<p>“Hmm… you must be the ones the president sent, am I correct?” She
guesses.</p>
<p>“And I assume you must be this ‘Rin-chan’ girl this letter was
mentioning.” Shiro mentions, holding the letter. Looks like both our
guesses were correct, seeing her reaction to the nickname.</p>
<p>“…please refrain from calling me by that name.” She quickly follows
up.</p>
<p>“Oh, sorry. Anyways, this is for you, then.” Shiro hands the letter
over to Rin. “Feel free to take your time reading it.”</p>
<p>She opens it up, grabbing the paper inside and silently reading it
for a few moments.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>She sighs. “President…” Then trails off, unsure of what to say.</p>
<p>And then, another moment of silence.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>“From what the letter says… you must be Shiro-sensei, am I correct?”
She then breaks the silence.</p>
<p><em>…Sensei?</em></p>
<p>“Yeah, Tendou Shiro, that’s me.” Shiro confirms. “To my left is
Tendou Niko, my brother.” Her eyes widen a bit when my name was
mentioned. What could that be all about…?</p>
<p>“Nice to meet you, miss… Nanagami?” I went ahead and used her last
name instead for good measure. She nods in response.</p>
<p>“And then, Hatora Emiya.”</p>
<p>“Hm. A pleasure to meet you.”</p>
<p>“To my right is Enami Kai…”</p>
<p>“Nice to meet ya, Rin.”</p>
<p>“…and lastly, Kantami Nano.”</p>
<p>Nano only nods in response.</p>
<p>“Likewise.” Rin nods. “My name is Nanagami Rin, current acting
president of Kivotos, the academy city.” Our eyes widen a bit at the
“Academy City” part.</p>
<p>“Wait, ‘Academy City’? Then that means…” Kai trails off, awaiting
Rin’s answer.</p>
<p>“Precisely. Kivotos is comprised of thousands of academies, and is
lead by Students.”</p>
<p>Our eyes widen even more discovering that information. A city lead by
students? Students most likely not even over the age of 18?
Interesting…</p>
<p>“Huh… wasn’t expecting that answer.” Kai responds, surprised.</p>
<p>“And from what the letter contained, it seems you were all sent here
by the president as teachers.”</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>Wait, hold on.</p>
<p>“Teachers?” I repeat what Rin had just said.</p>
<p>“Yes, but not in the traditional sense.” She affirms. “Students are
taught through Blu-Ray Disks and combat tapes. Instead of traditional
teaching, you will all instead act as ‘guides’ for them, as a way to
lead them to the right direction, as it seems.”</p>
<p>“Hmm…” Shiro ponders for a moment. “I see.”</p>
<p>“Y’know, Shiro? I envy you sometimes.” Kai starts.</p>
<p>“What?”</p>
<p>“You already know what you’re doing. Meanwhile, I feel like an ape
that just got dropped off in the middle of nowhere.” Weird analogy
there, but I get it.</p>
<p>“…hm, my apologies. I understand if this current situation may be
very confusing for all of you.” Rin apologizes, slightly bowing her
head. “However, I need you all to please follow me for now, as there is
something I require your help with.”</p>
<p>“What is it?” Shiro asks.</p>
<p>“Well… let’s just say that it could… determine the very fate of the
academy city as a whole.” Rin answers.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>“…oh, well, this just got more serious than expected.” Kai responds
after a moment.</p>
<p>“Hmm… alright. Lead the way, Miss Nanagami.” Emiya drops the topic,
signaling for us to go.</p>
<p>“You do not need to refer to me by my family name, Emiya-sensei.” Rin
adds before gesturing for us to follow her.</p>
<p>As we walk through the surprisingly large building, we end up in an
observation deck, where we all end up seeing a breathtaking view of
Kivotos.</p>
<p>“Well, then… to formally end the introductions…”</p>
<p><br> <br></p>
<center>
“Shiro-sensei,”
</center>
<p><br></p>
<center>
“Niko-sensei,”
</center>
<p><br></p>
<center>
“Kai-sensei,”
</center>
<p><br></p>
<center>
“Emiya-sensei,”
</center>
<p><br></p>
<center>
“and Nano-sensei.”
</center>
<p><br> <br> <br> <br></p>
<center>
<strong>“Welcome to Kivotos.”</strong>
</center>
<p><br></p>
<center>
<strong>“This is where you will all be working, from now on.”</strong>
</center>
<p><br> <br> <br></p>
<p>…</p>
<p>“…holy shit.”</p>
<p>“Woah…”</p>
<p>“Oh, wow…”</p>
<p>“This is…!”</p>
<p>We all speak in absolute awe, with Nano staying silent, as usual. The
sights below aren’t doing this city any justice.</p>
<p>A seemingly limitless and clean urban city, and a clear, pure blue
sky.</p>
<p>…this is beautiful.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>“It may be bound to be very different compared to where you all may
live, however, something tells me that you all will adapt and do just
fine here.” Rin breaks the silence.</p>
<p>“Well, as a member of this five-man nomadic group… you won’t have to
worry.” I speak, still taking in the sight.</p>
<p>“That’s good.” She smiles. “We can leave the rest of the details for
later.”</p>
<p>“Alright then. Anyways, what’s our-” Shiro is suddenly cut off by an
elevator ding.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>“<em>Oh dear, that might be them.</em>” I think to myself,
remembering the 4 girls at the ground floor.</p>
<p>…</p>
<hr />
<p>///// POV: Shiro /////</p>
<p>Noticing the ding, we all leave the observation deck, heading back to
the office lounge. Once we got there, we find four familiar girls
waiting. The one purple-haired girl in twintails in particular has an
annoyed expression.</p>
<p>“Ah! There you are, Acting President! We’ve all been waiting! Get the
real president in here already!” That same girl with the expression is
the first to break the silence, clearly angry.</p>
<p>“I’ve been waiting to see you, Chief Officer.” A second girl with
long, black hair follows up. As much as we tried, we couldn’t help but
notice her rather… developed body, and her MASSIVE black wings.</p>
<p>…no, that is not a word mask. Her wings are genuinely massive.</p>
<p>“I’m here to meet with the General Student Council president. The
Head Prefect has terms she would like to discuss.” A third girl with elf
ears in glasses follows up.</p>
<p>“Well… this timing is rather inconvenient.” Rin says, her eyes
pointed over to the side. Look’s like she’s also irritated.</p>
<p>Wearing a thinly veiled smile, Rin speaks up.</p>
<p>“Hello. guests that represent neighboring academies’ student council,
disciplinary boards, and those who otherwise have too much time on their
hands.”</p>
<p>…I have a feeling that last part is targeted.</p>
<p>“I am well aware why you irksome- I mean, important representatives
have come here today.” Me and the others suppress a light chuckle.</p>
<p>“You’re here to blame us for the fuss happening in the Academy City.
Isn’t that right?” Rin asks, her aura growing more and more menacing by
the second.</p>
<p>“If you’re well aware, then do something! You represent the General
Student Council, after all!” The first girl retorts. “Thousands of
academy districts are in panic! Our academy’s wind generator shut down
just a few days ago!” She follows up.</p>
<p>…did the president really just have a rope on everything?</p>
<p>“There are also rumors that a student under the Federal Corrections
Bureau’s custody has escaped.” The elf girl follows up too.</p>
<p>“There has been a sharp increase in the number of thugs attacking our
students on their way to school. Public safety is not being properly
enforced.” A fourth girl with white hair then follows up too. Strange, I
didn’t notice her there. And is that a single wing on her head…?</p>
<p>“Illegal distribution of tanks, choppers, and other unknown weapons
have increased by over 2000 percent. At this rate, ordinary school life
in Kivotos will be a thing of the past.”</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>A-wuh?</p>
<p>Wuh-huh?</p>
<p>Did I just hear that right?</p>
<p>Unknown weapons?</p>
<p>Choppers?</p>
<p><strong>Tanks?</strong></p>
<p><strong><em>By over 2000 percent!?</em></strong></p>
<p>…</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>Holy shit.</p>
<p>“…” Rin stays silent.</p>
<p>“And what is the General Student Council president doing during such
a sorry state of affairs? I demand to see her right this instant!” The
first girl commands.</p>
<p>Rin sighs, then speaks up again. Is she gonna mention that…?</p>
<p>“The president is not here at the moment. To be frank, she’s gone
missing.” There it is.</p>
<p>“What?!” The first girl gasps in surprise.</p>
<p>“…!” The elf girl says nothing, but her expression clearly shows
shock.</p>
<p>“So the rumors were true…” The winged girl confirms.</p>
<p>Rin speaks up once more.</p>
<p>“Allow me to cut to the chase. The General Student Council has no
authority because the top administrator of the Sanctum Tower has gone
missing.”</p>
<p>“We had been searching for a way to bypass the need for verification,
all to no avail… until recently.”</p>
<p>…I have a feeling.</p>
<p>“You mean you’ve found a way now, Chief Officer?” The winged girl
asks.</p>
<p>“That is correct. Sensei, or rather, the five Senseis here are the
answer to our problems.” Rin answers simply, pointing to our
direction.</p>
<p>…yep, feeling confirmed.</p>
<p>“…?!” The first girl makes a confused noise. Did she not notice us
this entire time?</p>
<p>“…!” The elf girl also follows.</p>
<p>“These people?” The winged girl asks, referring to us.</p>
<p>“Wait, us?” Kai asks, confused.</p>
<p>“Hold up. Who are these people you’re talking about? What are they
doing here in the first place?” The first girl asks.</p>
<p>“Don’t ask us or Rin. We’re also clueless on how we ended up here.”
Niko answers. “As for why we’re here… well, she can answer that.” He
quickly follows up.</p>
<p>“Whoever they all are, they don’t seem to be from Kivotos.”
Correct.</p>
<p>“Well, then. Shiro-sensei, would you mind if you all introduced
yourselves again?” Rin asks me, or, well, us.</p>
<p>“Not really, so, here.”</p>
<p>I can already hear some writing off Nano’s notebook.</p>
<p>“Tendou Shiro. Nice to meet you all.” I start.</p>
<p>“Tendou Niko. To repeat what I said to Ayumu: Same sentiment. And
yes, me and Shiro are siblings.” Niko follows up.</p>
<p>“Hatora Emiya. It’s a pleasure to meet you.” Then Emiya.</p>
<p>“Enami Kai. Nice to meet y’all.” Then Kai, and lastly…</p>
<center>
<i>Kantami Nano. Nice to meet you all too.</i>
</center>
<center>
<i>I use a notebook because my voice doesn’t work. Sorry.</i>
</center>
<p>…Nano. We all gesture to his notebook.</p>
<p>“Huh?” The first girl stops to read it. “Oh… hey, you don’t need to
apologize about that!” She exclaims, her tone softening a bit. Nano
really does bring out a more gentler side to some people, huh?</p>
<p>The other three read it, and their eyes widen in response. The elf
girl in particular showed a bit of empathy.</p>
<p>…gonna assume they haven’t experienced talking to mute people
before.</p>
<p>“Ahem.”</p>
<p>Rin fake-coughs to get our attention again. After that, she speaks
up.</p>
<p>“Introductions aside… not only are they going to be teaching in
Kivotos, but they’ve also been personally selected by the General
Student Council president.”</p>
<p>“Huh? The president chose them? The one who’s now missing?” Yeah, we
don’t know either. “Things are making less and less sense…”</p>
<p>“Well, as Rin said, introductions aside, I repeat, nice to meet you
all.” I greet the four.</p>
<p>“R-right. It’s good to meet you all. I’m Millennium Science
School’s…” …Millennium Science? I feel like I’ve heard of that somewhere
before.</p>
<p>“I-I mean, why am I even bothering to introduce myself right
now?”</p>
<p>“Don’t worry about that annoying girl. Let’s just move on…” Rin says
with another menacing smile.</p>
<p>“Who are you calling annoying?! I’m Hayase Yuuka! You should remember
that name, Sensei!” The first girl, Yuuka, tells us.</p>
<p>“Noted. Well, it’s nice to meet you too, Yuuka.” I say with a
smile.</p>
<p>“Hmm, well then. We should introduce ourselves too.” The winged girl
mentions.</p>
<p>“Hanekawa Hasumi. Member and tactical commander of the Trinity
Justice Task Force. Nice to meet you all.” She then starts. So, Hasumi…
noted.</p>
<p>“Hinomiya Chinatsu, member and medic of the Gehenna Prefect Team.
Nice to meet you too.” The elf girl, Chinatsu, follows up.</p>
<p>Trinity and Gehenna…</p>
<p>Heaven and Hell…</p>
<p>Coincidence, perhaps?</p>
<p>“Hmm, alright then. Morizuki Suzumi, member of the Trinity Vigilante
Crew. Nice to meet you, Senseis.” The white-haired girl with a wing on
her head, Suzumi, follows up last.</p>
<p>“Well, repeat again. Nice to meet you all.” I say, ending the
intoductions.</p>
<p>“Also, Rin. Can we get details on what exactly we’re here for?” Niko
asks.</p>
<p>“Ah, yes.” She begins.</p>
<p>“You’re all here to serve as the advisor for a club that was formed
by the General Student Council president.”</p>
<center>
<strong>“The Federal Investigation Club: Schale.”</strong>
</center>
<p>…hmm, federal investigation? That reminded me of the FBI, for some
reason.</p>
<p>“This isn’t your average club- rather, it is more like a type of
extrajudicial organization. Since it’s a federal club, you will all be
allowed to register students from any of the academies in Kivotos.” Oh.
That’s….</p>
<p>“You’re permitted to conduct battle activities in each academy
district without restriction.” …</p>
<p>…isn’t this a bit too much power for us? We’re basically just a bunch
of strangers here.</p>
<p>…I have a feeling that president knows a lot more about us than what
she’s showing here.</p>
<p>“How the president was able to create an organization with this much
power, I have no idea.” Rin adds.</p>
<p>“The Schale club room is about 30 kilometers from here. The building
is currently empty, but we had to put something in the basement at the
president’s request.”</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>Yeah, that president girl knows a lot more than she’s letting
off.</p>
<p>“It’s my job to take you there.” Rin then brings out a modern-looking
cellphone. “Momoka. I need a helicopter to take us to the Schale club
room.” She then begins speaking into it…? A radio, perhaps?</p>
<p>Shortly after, a hologram begins to manifest from it. Damn, their
technology’s advanced this far?</p>
<p>The hologram then shows a short-statured girl, most likely this
Momoka girl, with pink hair which looks to also be done in twintails,
similar to Yuuka. She’s also holding a bag of chips.</p>
<p>Oh, that’s an interesting halo. Five 4-pointed stars placed to
resemble a crown.</p>
<p>“The Schale club room?” Her voice has a light and lazy tone to it.
“That’s over in the outskirts. Things are kind of crazy over there right
now…” She adds.</p>
<p>“What do you mean ‘crazy’?” Rin asks.</p>
<p>“A suspended student escaped from the Corrections Bureau and is
wreaking havoc. It’s a battlefield over there right now!” Momoka follows
up. That doesn’t sound good.</p>
<p>“…what?” Rin asks, <strong>calmly</strong>.</p>
<p>“They rallied all the thugs in the area and are destroying everything
in their path to get revenge on the General Student Council. I hear
they’ve even got a Crusader Tank!”</p>
<p>“They must be trying to occupy the Schale building because they know
the General Student Council controls it. Maybe they think there’s
something valuable inside.”</p>
<p>“<em>The thing Rin mentioned that the president requested to be left
in the basement…</em>” I ponder.</p>
<p>Rin’s expression looks pissed off. <em>Really</em> pissed off.</p>
<p>“Oh, well. The city’s already a dump, so I don’t think it’ll make
that much of a difference… oh, great! The food I ordered is here. I’ll
talk to you later!” Momoka then hangs up the call.</p>
<p>“<em>…for probably being a member of this GSC, she’s pretty
nonchalant about everything currently happening.</em>”</p>
<p>I look back towards Rin, and notice she is, indeed, <em>very
much</em> pissed off.</p>
<p><em>snap</em></p>
<p>The phone in her hand then breaks from the overwhelming grip. Oh
no.</p>
<p>“Deep breaths, Rin. Deep breaths.” I tell her. She then faces towards
us with a menacing expression, making us all freeze on the spot.</p>
<p>…mental note to not irritate her has been saved.</p>
<p>“I’m fine… It’s just a minor setback. No problem at all.” She then
lied, showing a fake, menacing smile.</p>
<p>Suddenly, she realizes something, and faces herself towards the four
girls instead.</p>
<p>“…?” Hasumi is the first to notice.</p>
<p>“What? Why are you looking at us like that?” Yuuka asks, a bit
intimidated.</p>
<p>Hmm… guns, and 30 kilometers of traveling… I have a feeling
again.</p>
<p>“It’s so reassuring to have you trustworthy academy representatives
here with us.” Rin starts with a menacing smile again. Not there just
yet…</p>
<p>“Huh?”</p>
<p>“We are going to need your help to bring peace back to Kivotos. Let’s
go.” And there it is.</p>
<p>Rin then walks away, with me and the others following suite, making
sure to not tempt fate and anger her further.</p>
<p>Though, she then suddenly stops in her tracks.</p>
<p>“Oh, I’ve almost forgotten.” Rin says, realizing something.</p>
<p>“What is it?” I ask.</p>
<p>“We aren’t sure, but the president had mentioned that it would be
important for all of you.” She answers.</p>
<p>“Huh?”</p>
<p>“Could you please wait here for a moment?” She asks us.</p>
<p>“Well, sure…” I answer, not exactly sure on what she meant by
that.</p>
<p>“Thank you.” She then walks off to grab something from somewhere.</p>
<p>“Wait, so where are we going?” Yuuka asks, confused.</p>
<p>“We’ll probably be off to regain access to the Sanctum Tower, given
the current situation.” Emiya answers.</p>
<p>“Oh… wait, why do we have to be the ones to fight them?!” She shouts
indignantly.</p>
<p>“Well, you’re the only ones here at the moment with more than capable
weapons, so…” Kai trails off, letting them connect the dots.</p>
<p>Yuuka sighs. “This day is getting more and more chaotic every passing
minute…”</p>
<p>After a moment, Rin eventually returns with something that
immediately incites a heavy reaction out of us.</p>
<p>“Huh?!” Me and Niko shout in surprise.</p>
<p>“That is…!” Emiya responds, also surprised.</p>
<p>“Wait, what?! What the HELL is Nano’s staff doing here?!” Kai
practically shouts, also surprised.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Nano is only staring in shock, his eyes as wide as they
can be. All of the girls are caught off-guard, Rin included.</p>
<p>Quickly regaining her composure, Rin speaks up.</p>
<p>“Those reactions… that means this is important to all of you, yes?”
She asks us.</p>
<p>“…yes, very much. <strong>Especially</strong> to Nano.” I answer.</p>
<p>“Huh? What is that?” Yuuka asks, noticing the staff.</p>
<p>“Hmm… it looks like those magic staffs you’d see in fantasy movies.”
Chinatsu answers indirectly as she scrutinizes it.</p>
<p>“Why did you all react like that to seeing it?” Suzumi inquires,
curious.</p>
<p>“Well… if it works, then… I’ll just have you all see it for
yourselves.” I answer. “Rin, can we have that staff?” I ask Rin.</p>
<p>“None of us truly ever found out what it is for, so… I suppose.” She
then hands it over to me.</p>
<p>“Well… as I said, you’ll just have to see it for yourselves.”</p>
<hr />
<p><em>Nano’s magic staff.</em></p>
<p><em>The one thing that allows him to use more magic by an actual
order of magnitude.</em></p>
<p><em>We thought we had lost it a few months ago, after it suddenly
disappeared, but…</em></p>
<p><em>…turns out it was just here all along.</em></p>
<p><em>Somehow.</em></p>
<p><em>…just what is that president keeping hidden?</em></p>
<hr />
<p>I move over to Nano, handing the staff to him. He was hesitant at
first, but breaks out of his trance and grabs it shortly after.</p>
<p>“Well then, an opportunity to show what you’re capable of.” Kai
says.</p>
<p>“Could you guys stand back for a moment?” Niko asks the others.</p>
<p>“Huh? Why?” Yuuka asks.</p>
<p>“As I said, you’ll see.” I answer. “You ready, Nano?” I ask him. He
nods in response.</p>
<p>“Alright, everyone, stand back!” Emiya commands.</p>
<hr />
<p>///// POV: Nano /////</p>
<p><em>Is this… really my staff?</em></p>
<p>I look at the others, and they’re giving me a look of assurance.
Though, the girls are looking at us with confusion and curiosity.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p><em>Okay, Nano, come on. You can do this.</em></p>
<p>Taking a deep breath, I close my eyes and began to channel the
magical capabilities I have.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>“Huh?!” Yuuka exclaims.</p>
<p>“His body is glowing!” Suzumi points out. <em>It’s working…</em></p>
<p>“Wait, what’s that below him?” Chinatsu asks.</p>
<p>“A magic circle manifesting.” Kai answers simply.</p>
<p>“Wait, MAGIC?!” Yuuka exclaims again.</p>
<p>“Hush.” Emiya silences the group. I notice that Shiro, Niko, Rin and
Hasumi haven’t said anything yet.</p>
<p>Filtering out the background noise, I go back to focusing,</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>…</p>
<p><em>I can feel it.</em></p>
<p>Magic begins to flow all around my body, moving without a direction.
<em>It’s still unstable…</em></p>
<p>I then steel myself, focusing on letting it flow towards the
staff.</p>
<p><em>Come on…!</em></p>
<hr />
<p>///// POV: Kai /////</p>
<p>“<em>Holy shit, it’s actually working!</em>” I think to myself as
Nano’s body begins glowing even more intensely, wrapping him in a
sky-blue light. The magic circle below him is also beginning to take
form, showing a beautiful flower pattern around him and a normal magic
circle around it. The staff is also beginning to glow, too.</p>
<p>So far, everyone else hasn’t said a word, instead opting to just look
at the unfolding events before them in awe.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>It <em>might</em> just have dawned on me that we’re basically just
obliterating their original worldview.</p>
<p>Oh well.</p>
<hr />
<p>///// POV: Shiro /////</p>
<p>As we watch Nano’s magic show take place, the air suddenly starts to
become heavier. At the same time, the aura around him intensifies.</p>
<p>“What’s going on?!” Yuuka asks in panic, noticing it.</p>
<p>“Niko-sensei, what’s happening?!” Rin asks Niko, also in a panic.</p>
<p>“The air just got heavy! Everyone, brace yourselves!” He shouts out.
The others follow silently as they begin to steel themselves.</p>
<p>“What do you me-”</p>
<p><em>BOOOOM</em></p>
<p>“WOAH!”/“OH BOY!” Me and Niko exclaim.</p>
<p>Yuuka gets cut off as Nano’s magic manifestation completes, causing
an explosion of pressure which pushes all of us back.</p>
<p>All of us manage to stay upright, except for Yuuka herself and
Kai.</p>
<p>“Ow!”/“Gah!” The two lets out a sound of pain as they hit the
ground.</p>
<p>“You guys okay?” I ask the group.</p>
<p>“Ugh… yeah, I think. God, my ass did not need that right now…” Kai
answers, groaning.</p>
<p>“Just what is even going on at this point?!” Yuuka exclaims,
overwhelmed.</p>
<p>“You haven’t seen everything just yet, Yuuka…” I trail off, looking
back at Nano’s direction.</p>
<p>The glow fades away, revealing none other than Nano himself,
surrounded by tiny glowing orbs. His staff is emitting a vibrant
sky-blue light, and the magic circle beneath him has shrinked down
significantly, just managing to span across him.</p>
<p>We stay silent in anticipation, since his eyes are still closed.</p>
<hr />
<p>///// POV: Nano /////</p>
<p>…</p>
<p><em>Did… it work?</em></p>
<p>Everyone’s staying silent. <em>This really doesn’t help me.</em></p>
<p>Reluctantly, I slowly open my eyes. What then meets me is none other
than my staff, now letting out a sky-blue glow. <em>It… it
worked…</em></p>
<p>“…Earth to Nano? You okay?” Kai calls out to me.</p>
<p>Slowly, I face myself towards them. Their eyes widen in surprise.</p>
<p>“His left eye is glowing…” Chinatsu points out.</p>
<p>“Woah…” Suzumi stares in deep intrigue.</p>
<p>“…did it work?” Kai asks me.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p><em>Everything seems to have gone well, so…</em></p>
<hr />
<p>///// POV: Kai /////</p>
<p>Nano nods as an answer to my question.</p>
<p>“…that confirms it. That is indeed, your missing staff.” Emiya
concludes.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>“…Shiro-sensei?” Rin calls out to Shiro.</p>
<p>“Yeah?”</p>
<p>“…once we reclaim the Sanctum Tower, we all personally demand an
explanation.” She demands, brokering no room for arguments.</p>
<p>“…sure. We all owe you guys one.” Shiro answers, concluding the
moment.</p>
<p>“For now, know that we’re also gonna be helping y’all in reaching the
tower.”</p>
<p>“…I see. Shall we go, then?”</p>
<p>“You ready to go, Nano?”</p>
<p>He nods again in response.</p>

“Alright then, here goes nothing…”
